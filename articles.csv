Hence, “housewives” and “retirees” who are looking for and available for work, as well as the long-term unemployed, are included in the unemployed figures.
Full-time national servicemen are not included because the nature of their NS obligation means they cannot be actively seeking work nor be available for work.

The compilation of unemployment statistics in Singapore adheres strictly to international standards set by:
    - International Labour Organisation (ILO)
    - International Monetary Fund (IMF)
IMF regularly monitors observance of the requirements and any discrepancy or non-adherence will be highlighted.
The IMF has never highlighted any doubts about the labour statistics released by Singapore.

                Can the prices in the 1962 Water Agreement be revised?
            ","
                    09 Jul 2018
                ","What is the 1962 Water Agreement?
 
Under the 1962 Water Agreement, Singapore has the full and exclusive right to draw up to 250 million imperial gallons per day (mgd) of water from the Johor River at a price of 3 sen per thousand gallons.
 
In return, Johor is entitled to buy treated water up to 2 per cent of the total quantity of water we import to Singapore on any given day. In other words, Johor is entitled to buy up to about 5 mgd of treated water, provided that Singapore is able to draw its full entitlement of 250 mgd of water from the Johor River. 
 
Under the 1962 Water Agreement, Johor is entitled to buy treated water at 50 sen per thousand gallons. Malaysia benefits from this pricing arrangement, as 50 sen per thousand gallons is only a fraction of the true cost to Singapore of treating the water. 
 
At Malaysia’s request, Singapore has been supplying Johor with treated water in excess of Johor’s entitlement under the 1962 Water Agreement. This excess treated water is supplied at the same price as under the 1962 Water Agreement. This is done out of goodwill and without prejudice to our rights under the 1962 Water Agreement. Singapore has in fact been regularly supplying Johor with 16 mgd, and up to 22 mgd at times, of treated water. 
 
Can the water prices in the Agreement be revised?
 
Both Singapore and Malaysia must comply fully with all the provisions of the 1962 Water Agreement, including the price of water stipulated in it. Any breach of the 1962 Water Agreement would call into question the Separation Agreement, which is the fundamental basis of Singapore’s very existence as an independent sovereign state. Neither Singapore nor Malaysia can unilaterally change the terms of this solemn agreement.
 
The 1962 Water Agreement provided for a price review after 25 years. Specifically, there was a right to review the price jointly in 1987. Malaysia, however, did not exercise this right in 1987. Since the right to review has lapsed, neither Singapore nor Malaysia can unilaterally change the price of water sold to Singapore. 
 
In the event Malaysia chose not to review the water price in 1987, and on that basis, Singapore then took several actions which also benefitted Malaysia. This included building the Linggiu Dam at the cost of over S$300 million, which has increased the yield of the Johor River. 
 
The terms of the 1962 Water Agreement were most recently reaffirmed between our two countries in January 2018 at the 8th Singapore-Malaysia Leaders’ Retreat. 
 
Do we have enough water to meet our needs?
 
Water is fundamental to our survival, and is a scarce and precious resource.
 
Recognising our water vulnerability, we have consciously and steadily developed two additional weather-resilient local sources (NEWater and desalinated water). Together with local catchments and imported water, they form our Four National Taps, and provide Singapore with robust and sustainable water supply.
 
The quantity of imported water is limited by the amount of water we can draw under the 1962 Water Agreement, i.e., up to 250 mgd. 
 
Growth in our local catchments is limited, as two-thirds of our island is already water catchment area. This means that any additional water supply will have to be provided by NEWater or desalinated water. While NEWater and desalinated water are weather-resilient, they are costlier to produce. Water has to be priced to reflect the long-run marginal cost (LRMC) of producing and conveying our next drop of water, which is likely to come from NEWater and desalinated water. 
 
Our water demand is increasing. By 2060, our water use is projected to about double from today’s 430 mgd. We must therefore plan ahead to find the needed water and invest in weather-resilient water sources. Today, we have three desalination plants. By 2020, we will have two more plants at Marina East and Jurong Island. This year, we started works on Phase Two of the Deep Tunnel Sewerage System (DTSS), which will enhance our used water management, and boost NEWater production when completed in 2025.  
 
We will continue to build up our desalination and NEWater capacities. By 2060, these two sources will be able to meet up to 85 per cent of our water needs then. 
 
Make every drop count
 
While PUB addresses the supply of water to cater for future demand, all of us have to better manage our usage patterns and learn to use water more wisely. 
 
Our household water consumption has decreased from 148 litres per person per day in 2016 to 143 litres in 2017. Our water conservation efforts are showing results, but we must do better. 
 
Do your part. Save water where you can. Make every drop count.

                ","
The Transient Workers Count Too is a non-profit organisation set up to “promote fair treatment for foreign workers.” Over the years, TWC2 has published various articles about foreign workers’ and their volunteers’ experiences.

However, TWC2 has published inaccurate or false information on many occasions. The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) has investigated the claims and published their investigations and facts surrounding the cases. A few examples are highlighted below.



 
TWC2 claim: 
Alaguraja was injured at work and was brought to his “company” clinic in Lavender. His employer influenced the clinic and compelled him to continue working after his injury. 
MOM clarifies: 
Alaguraja indicated in his statement to MOM that he went to the Lavender clinic on his own, without any employer’s representatives, and stopped working the day he was injured. 

 
TWC2 claim: 
Hossain’s work injury claim took over 15 months, and his employer failed to pay for his upkeep. Injured workers are not allowed to work or leave Singapore during the claims process.  
MOM clarifies: 
Hossain only reported his injury to MOM more than six months after it happened. MOM completed the investigations and issued a Notice of Assessment within eight months. However, Hossain later withdrew the claim to pursue his claim under common law.
Hossain did not face any problems with his employer, who was prepared to keep his work permit “live” and take him back, should Hossain recover fully. The employer had also paid for Hossain’s air ticket to and from Bangladesh when he requested to go home for medical treatment.

 
TWC2 claim: 
Sarkar came to work in Singapore as an S-Pass holder, and was made to remain in the country by MOM to assist in investigations. He was denied upkeep assistance and could not find a job because of MOM’s “poor” policies. 
MOM clarifies: 
Sarkar had multiple job offers, including air-con servicing, dormitory servicing and manufacturing, but of his own volition, rejected most of them. 
MOM had offered to assist him with food and accommodation but he had declined the offer twice. Sarkar denied telling TWC2 that he needed to pay for his own food and accommodation. He was aware that he could approach MOM should he require help but had not done so as his friend was supporting him. 
MOM wishes to highlight the following...
Reporting injuries directly: Workers can report their injuries to MOM directly if they suspect that their employers are trying to circumvent reporting, or influencing doctors to under-prescribe medical leave. 
 
Help for work injury, upkeep and accommodation issues: Foreign workers who need help for these issues are strongly encouraged to contact MOM’s helpline directly at 6438 5122 or www.mom.gov.sg/eservices, the Migrant Workers’ Centre at 6536 2692, or their respective embassies/high commissions.

                Did the Government introduce CareShield Life to make money off Singaporeans?
            ","
                    30 Jun 2018
                ","A misleading text message is being circulated on messaging platforms claiming that CareShield Life was introduced by the Government to reap profits off Singaporeans. It also suggests that the risk of severe disability is very low, making it unlikely for policyholders to make a claim.
This is what the message looks like:
 
The claims are untrue.
Claim: Schemes like ElderShield and CareShield Life were introduced to profit off Singaporeans, and the premiums collected become Government surpluses. 
Fact: The Government will not profit from CareShield Life.
The premiums collected and returns from investments will stay within the fund so that policyholders can benefit through higher payouts or premium rebates.
Today, premiums collected under ElderShield are more than the claims paid out, as most policyholders are relatively young. However, these premiums collected do not become Government surpluses. Rather, they are meant for future claims – when policyholders become older and more of them make claims for severe disabilities (see Figure 1 for a comparison of premiums collected versus claims).
All CareShield Life premiums collected will remain within the fund meant for policyholders. It will not be transferred to other Government schemes.
Claim: The number of people who suffer from severe disability in old age is very few or close to none. Likewise, the number of claims.
Fact: As our population ages, one in two Singaporeans who is healthy at age 65 could become severely disabled in their lifetime. 
This is backed by evidence. From 2013 to 2017, the annual claims paid out have risen more (up by 12%) than the annual premiums collected (up by 3%). This trend is expected to continue as more Singaporeans enter their silver years.
The duration of severe disability and the accompanying costs of long-term care will vary. Coupled with shrinking family sizes, it will be challenging to rely solely on personal and family savings to pay for one’s long-term care needs. While the expected median duration for severely disabled individuals to remain in disability is around 4 years, three in 10 severely disabled individuals are expected to remain in disability for 10 years or more.
Schemes like ElderShield and the new CareShield Life will ensure that Singaporeans are protected against the variability in duration and the cost of long-term care needed. The Government will also provide subsidies to ensure that CareShield Life remains affordable for all Singaporeans.
Four ways how CareShield Life will provide better protection and assurance for Singaporeans’ long-term care:

                How much will I get in GST Vouchers in 2018?
            ","
                    29 Jun 2018
                ","The GST Voucher (GSTV) is a permanent scheme introduced by the Government in 2012 to help lower-income Singaporeans with their GST expenses. The GSTV comprises three components – Cash, MediSave and U-Save.
In total, about 1.6 million eligible Singaporeans will receive a total of $1 billion worth of GST Vouchers and MediSave Top-Ups in 2018. Eligible HDB households will also receive an additional U-Save of $20 a year from 2019 to 2021, in addition to the regular U-Save amounts.
Do I qualify?
Confused by the different criteria for the GST Vouchers? Here’s a quick and simple guide for you.
GST Voucher – Cash
For a start, in order to qualify for GSTV – Cash this year, you must first be a Singapore citizen, staying in Singapore. You must also be aged 21 or above.
Next, your income earned in 2016 (as assessed by IRAS for the Year of Assessment 2017) must not exceed $28,000.
Also, the annual value of your home [1] must not be above $21,000 as of 31 December 2017. You must also not own more than one property.
If you satisfy all of the above requirements, you qualify. So how much do you get? The amount of Cash and Special Payment you get depends on the annual value of your home. See below: 
* Cheque payment takes two weeks longer. Citizens are encouraged to switch to direct bank crediting at www.gstvoucher.gov.sg.
GST Voucher – MediSave
Besides GSTV – Cash, if you are a Singapore citizen aged 65 and above and staying in Singapore, you may also receive GSTV – MediSave.
As with the Cash component, the annual value of your home must not exceed $21,000 as of 31 December 2017, and you must not own more than one property.
If you meet the above criteria, the amount of GSTV – MediSave top-up you receive will depend on your age in 2018 and the annual value of your home. See below:

In addition to the above, if you are aged 59 years and above in 2018 and do not receive Pioneer Generation benefits, you will receive a MediSave top-up of up to $200 in 2018. The amount of top-ups depends on the annual value of your home. 

Pioneers will also receive Pioneer Generation (PG) MediSave top-ups of $200 to $800, depending on their age. 

Taking the GSTV – MediSave, PG MediSave Top-Up and 5-year MediSave together, here’s how much you may receive:


* Includes GSTV – MediSave, PG MediSave Top-Up and 5-year MediSave Top-Up (MTS5)
GST Voucher – U-Save
Lastly, eligible households will also receive GSTV – U-Save, which is credited to their utilities account. To qualify, your family must first stay in a HDB flat, and there must be at least one Singapore citizen owner, occupier or tenant in your HDB flat.
In addition, immediate family members living in the same HDB flat must not own or have any interest in more than one property.
The amount of U-Save you get depends on your HDB flat type. Each eligible household will receive the U-Save distributed every 3 months, as shown in the table below.

* Eligible HDB households will receive an additional U-Save of $20 a year from 2019 to 2021

You will also receive a one-off Service & Conservancy Charges rebate in 2018. This amount will vary according to your HDB flat type:
Doing more for the environment – mobile SMS notifications
If you have previously signed up for the GSTV or any other government payout scheme, you will automatically receive your GSTV payouts. For those who have not signed up, you will have until 31 December 2018 to sign up through the GSTV website (www.gstvoucher.gov.sg), or through a hardcopy form (found at Community Centres).
This year, if you have updated your mobile number with SingPass, you would have received SMS notifications about your GST Voucher – Cash and MediSave eligibility on 28 or 29 June. This is faster, more convenient, and eco-friendly as well. The sender of the SMS would be ""GSTV"", and the SMS would request that you log into www.gstvoucher.gov.sg with your SingPass details to view the benefits. However, beware of phishing websites, which may ask you for personal information without SingPass authentication.

If you are aged 21 to 58 with mobile numbers updated with SingPass, you will only receive SMS notifications (without hardcopy letters). If you are 59 and above with mobile numbers updated with SingPass, you will receive both SMSes and notification letters. You can opt for SMS notifications in future by updating your mobile numbers with SingPass at www.singpass.gov.sg.

[1] The AV is the estimated annual rent a property can fetch if it were to be rented out. It is used to calculate the property tax of your home. The AV can be found on the property tax bill that the property owner receives each year. The AV threshold of $21,000 covers all HDB flats and some lower-value private properties, as the GST Voucher targets those who are less well-off.

By ‘phishing’, perpetrators try to get personal information such as your bank account details, PIN, one-time password (OTP), and credit card number. They can then use this information to perform unauthorised banking transactions.
One common phishing method is to send you a spoofed (fake) e-mail that’s supposedly from your bank, using the following tactics to get you to release your information. 
 
Rise in phishing attempts
There has been an increase in the number of phishing emails sent recently. These e-mails appear to be sent by well-known banks, asking customers to update their personal particulars, including information on their bank accounts. The information targeted by scammers includes personal data such as bank account details, online banking user names, and passwords. Some e-mails claim that it is a Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) requirement for bank customers to provide such information. This is not true. 
If you receive such e-mails, alert your bank immediately. 
If you suspect that your bank account user ID, personal identification number or security token has been compromised, or if you identify any suspicious transactions on your bank account, contact your bank right away!  
Protect yourself
Take these steps to ensure that you don’t fall for any phishing attempts.
While banks will alert customers of any known phishing activity, do protect yourself online and do not fall prey to cyber criminals.

                Are digital tokens such as cryptocurrencies a simple, safe, and sure-fire way of making money? 
            ","
                    01 Jun 2018
                ","What are digital tokens? 
Digital tokens refer generally to a category of digitally-recorded instruments, which include digital payment tokens, or more commonly known as cryptocurrencies, and tokens issued through initial coin offerings. But some of these names are misleading. For example, cryptocurrencies are not actual currencies. You’ll never hold a digital token in your hand: digital tokens do not have a physical form unlike coins or notes. But that’s not the only trait of a real currency that digital tokens lack.
 
Because digital tokens aren’t issued by any government, they’re not legal tender. This means that consumers can only use digital tokens to pay merchants who are willing to accept them at whatever exchange value the merchants offer, as a mode of payment. Like most other jurisdictions, the Monetary Authority of Singapore currently does not regulate digital tokens.
 
Why do digital tokens seem so popular? 
With thousands of digital tokens worldwide, including Bitcoin, Ether, and Litecoin, it seems like a whole new world of possibilities. Last year’s surging markets also led some people to think that digital tokens could make them money quickly and with little effort. 
 
The hype is further boosted by digital token intermediaries who profit when people buy, sell, and exchange digital tokens through them. Because the value of any digital token is only as valuable as people deem it to be, speculators and digital token intermediaries have a vested interest in making the digital token bandwagon sound as attractive as possible.
 
 

Are digital tokens regulated?
No, digital tokens are not regulated because they are not issued by the Singapore government and are not legal tender. There is no legislative protection for those who lose money from investing in digital tokens. 
However, this doesn’t mean that the Government isn’t taking steps to ensure that digital tokens are not used as tools for fraud or other crimes.  Under the proposed Payment Services Bill, the Monetary Authority of Singapore will be imposing Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) requirements on digital token intermediaries.
 
Is it true you can definitely make money from investing in digital tokens?
Money doesn’t grow on trees, and investments are never a sure-win. Digital token investments, in particular, are an extremely high-risk, speculative instrument. 
Digital tokens are not backed by any assets or issuer, which means that no one bears any legal responsibility for the money you put into digital tokens. Simply put, you are making an investment with a party that cannot be held accountable. It is as good as taking a gamble.
Very few merchants accept digital tokens as payment, making them far less functional than actual currencies. 
 
What are the risks of investing in digital tokens?
There are four serious aspects of digital tokens which make them highly risky: their speculative nature, their lack of transparency, their exposure to hackers and fraud, and their insufficient secondary market liquidity.
 
Speculative Nature
What’s the value of digital tokens actually based on?
Digital tokens are highly speculative instruments whose value is not underpinned by any asset, or backed by any issuer. They are generated by computer code, running on decentralized networks, powered by blockchain technology which remains challenging for most people to thoroughly understand. 



As DPM Tharman pointed out, digital tokens investments are “in fact an inherently unstable, high risk game...subject to sharp swings in prices driven by speculation.” Should worst comes to worst, a digital token’s price could plummet to zero, be rendered worthless, and leave investors with none of their capital.

Furthermore, there is little information to help investors gauge their value. Many don’t know enough to fully comprehend digital tokens, much less conduct their own research to verify what they are told.
Lack of transparency
Can I put my trust in digital token transactions?
Digital tokens are mainly traded on opaque markets, with zero regulatory protection for investors. Digital token transactions are generally anonymous, which make them easily misused for unlawful activities. If a digital token intermediary has been found using digital tokens illegally, their operations can be shut down by law enforcement agencies. When that happens, investors who have transacted with such an intermediary could lose all their money.
Can I make digital token transactions with peace of mind?
When dealing with digital token intermediaries, you could be exposed to a greater risk of fraud and massive losses. Most digital token intermediaries don’t have a presence in Singapore, making it even harder to verify their credibility or authenticity. If the platform collapses, it’ll be difficult to trace the platform’s operators. 
Even if digital token platforms don’t collapse, they might still be taken down by malicious actors. Digital token intermediaries may not be sufficiently robust against hackers. For example, after South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Youbit was hacked for a second time, it had to file for bankruptcy in December 2017.
 
Exposure to hackers and fraud, insufficient secondary market liquidity 
What else could jeopardize my digital token investment?
Your digital tokens are stored in a digital wallet. Similar to digital token intermediaries, the digital wallet could be hacked. You could lose all your digital tokens as a result.
On top of that, fraud has already occurred with companies that claim to offer digital token-related products and services. Initial coin offerings disguised as Ponzi schemes are not uncommon. Platforms like OneCoin and BitConnect have been shut down for their pyramid schemes, with BitConnect’s price crashing from $452 to $9. 
Other fraud cases see pump-and-dump maneuvers, where the price of a digital token is artificially inflated by insiders through false and misleading exaggerations. When the price reaches a feverish peak, these insiders then cash out en masse, all at once, leading to a price collapse.
Finally, there is also the risk that you may not be able to exit your digital token investment easily. There may not be enough active buyers and sellers in the secondary market for digital tokens. You might never get the chance to cash out and liquidate your investment.
 
What should I do before making any investment decisions?
Do your homework – make sure you fully understand the benefits and risks of the product or service. 
Make a thorough assessment on whether the features of the product or service are suitable to your needs.
Before finally committing to an investment, you should ask, check and confirm.
Ask as many questions as you need to fully understand the investment.
Check and double-check if the information provided to you (e.g. company’s track records, owners and directors’ experience and qualifications) is actually true, and whether there are any complaints or negative comments made about the investment opportunity (whether in the news or on online forums.
Confirm the legitimacy of the seller or its representative’s credentials with external resources such as:

                Did the PTC change the fare formula to raise public transport fares?
            ","
                    18 May 2018
                ","There has been speculation that the Public Transport Council (PTC) made changes to the fare formula in a bid to raise public transport fares. 
Factually sets the record straight.
What is the PTC and what do they do?
The PTC conduct the annual fare review exercises as well as regular reviews of the fare formula to keep fares affordable and ensure that the public transport system remains financially sustainable. Its members represent a wide spectrum of society. 
Here’s how the previous formula looked:

This formula was valid from 2012 to 2017, and a new formula is needed for the next 5 years.
On 22 March 2018, PTC concluded its review, and introduced a revised formula valid from 2018 to 2022. This formula has a new Network Capacity Factor (NCF) to reflect the recurrent operating costs due to capacity adjustments, such as running more trains and buses over longer distances for less crowded and more convenient public transport rides.  
Here’s how the new formula looks:

Will the new formula result in higher fares?  
The fare adjustment quantum depends collectively on the different components in the fare formula, i.e. the existing macroeconomic indicators that reflect inflation (cCPI), wages (WI) and energy costs (EI), as well as the new NCF. 
Why do we need the NCF in the new fare formula?
The costs of running public transport are affected by a number of factors, including the price and quantity of the resources deployed. For example, expenditure on electricity in a particular year will depend on the quantity of electricity consumed during that year, and the prevailing electricity tariffs.  
While the previous fare formula adequately measured the changes in the price of resources consumed, it did not measure the changes in the quantity. When the capacity of the public transport network is quite stable from year to year, this limitation of the old fare formula is not material. However, as we aggressively expand the capacity of our public transport network, this can have a material impact on our public transport system’s sustainability. PTC designed the NCF to address this limitation in the previous fare formula.  
The Network Capacity Factor may be positive or negative.  It will be positive where demand grows slower than capacity.  Conversely, if capacity remains stagnant in a given year and demand grows faster than capacity, resulting in more crowded trains, the Network Capacity Factor will be negative.

So the NCF is meant to claw back the gap between costs and fares? 
No. While the NCF ensures a more equitable sharing of operating costs of capacity enhancements between commuters, taxpayers and operators, it does not:
But doesn’t the NCF pass on all the additional costs to commuters?
It doesn’t. The Government will continue to share the costs by subsidising public transport services heavily. Over the next five years, it will provide subsidies of about $5 billion for public bus services and $4 billion to renew our rail operating assets. This will help keep fares affordable even as more trains and buses are added to improve service standards. 
The Government will also continue to bear the full cost of constructing new rail lines, bus depots and interchanges and other public transport infrastructure. This amounts to around $20 billion over the next five years.
When will I know the fare adjustment?
As with previous years, the PTC will conduct the annual fare review exercise in the later part of the year, and will announce the actual fare adjustment in 4Q 2018 when the exercise is completed.

                Is Singapore the most expensive city to live in?
            ","
                    31 Jul 2018
                "," 
  
In the Economist Intelligence Unit’s (EIU) Worldwide Cost of Living (WCOL) survey conducted in 2017, Singapore was ranked as the most expensive city for expatriates to live in for the fifth consecutive year. The WCOL survey is designed to allow HR managers and expatriates to compare the cost of living in 133 cities globally, and to enable the HR managers to work out appropriate compensation policies when relocating employees. 
The survey findings do not reflect the cost of living of Singaporean households. Here’s why:
1. All prices are converted from local currencies to US dollars1, which means that the rankings are sensitive to currency fluctuations.
From 2004 to 2016, the Singapore dollar appreciated by nearly 18% against the US dollar. This significantly increased the price of goods and services expressed in US dollar terms, thus contributing to the rise in Singapore's ranking in the EIU survey over this period. In 2017,  the Singapore dollar appreciated further against the US dollar, which in turn was likely to have kept Singapore’s ranking high.

While such currency fluctuations affect the rankings and cost of living of expatriates who earn their income in foreign currencies, they have less impact on Singaporeans who earn their income in the local currency. 


2. The items in the EIU consumption basket2 are quite different from the goods and services regularly consumed by Singaporeans.
For example, the EIU’s consumption basket includes items like filet mignon and international foreign daily newspapers. Comparatively, the typical Singaporean consumption basket includes items such as local newspapers and chicken rice, which tend to be less expensive.


3. The prices of comparable items in the EIU survey are higher than what Singaporeans pay3
For example, in its publication, the EIU reports the prices of items such as bread and unleaded petrol.4 For these items, the prices in the surveys conducted by the Department of Statistics (DOS), which are more representative of what Singaporeans pay, are lower or closer to the lower end of the price range reported by EIU.
In fact, for comparable items in both the EIU and Singaporean consumption baskets, the prices of close to 95% of them are lower in DOS 5surveys than in the EIU survey. Among these items, about 40% had prices that are less than half of EIU’s prices. The tables below compare the prices of some commonly purchased items6 collected by DOS and EIU.

1 EIU converts all prices to US dollars because the WCOL survey is intended as an international guide to global companies.
2 DOS has comparable data for about 120 out of 170 items included in the EIU WCOL basket.
3 In all cities, including Singapore, the WCOL survey selects items from stores frequented by expatriates, which tend to be higher priced than those used by the general population in a given city.
4These items were chosen by EIU as they make up a significant share of household expenditure in a wide range of cities globally.
5 DOS collects the price data for more than 6,600 brands/varieties of goods and services in its monthly and yearly surveys. Prices of selected items are published in the Singstat Table Builder.
6 These items have been selected by MTI for illustrative purposes as they are items regularly purchased by Singaporeans.
7The price range for the monthly electricity bill in the EIU survey is based on the consumption of a spacious property serving a wealthy expatriate family of four (plus possible domestic helpers).

                Singapore’s national reserves: Is the Government excessively prudent?
            ","
                    18 May 2018
                ","There have been suggestions that the Government is excessively prudent and that too much investment income is put back into the national reserves. Some have cited the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) general guidance on reserves adequacy, which appear to advocate a less conservative approach than what Singapore is practising.
What is the IMF’s guidance on reserves?
IMF’s recommendation is meant to cater only for one specific risk: the risk of capital flight. This refers to the risk of a large scale exodus of financial assets from a country, due to a loss of confidence in the national currency. IMF’s recommendation does not address other risks.
However, we need to be ready for crises that go beyond capital flight risks. Singapore is a small and open economy. This means that we will always be vulnerable to fluctuations in the global economy and financial markets. We must be prepared to deal with unforeseen events and crises which can have a very significant impact on Singapore.
What were some of the crises we faced in the past?
In 2009, Singapore’s economy was severely threatened amidst the Global Financial Crisis. Fortunately, the Government sought the President’s approval for a $150 billion guarantee on all bank deposits in Singapore to be backed by the reserves, and to draw on $4.9 billion of reserves to fund two one-off measures to boost the economy.
Beyond preparing for future economic crises, we need to continue to anticipate other forms of crises that may impact Singapore, such as security or health emergencies.
International developments today highlight that the future is ever-changing and uncertain. We can never predict where or when the next crisis will come.
How can we grow our revenues while saving for the future?
Even as we save for future crises, we are still benefitting from the reserves now. Contributions from reserves are already the largest contributor to government revenues today. If we did not have our reserves to generate investment returns to spend from, we would have had to more than double personal income tax, or Goods and Services Tax (GST), to raise the same amount of revenue.
Singapore has a significant financial advantage in being able to tap on the contributions from our reserves for spending, instead of using the money to pay interest on debt.

                Why did the Government increase the foreign domestic worker levy?
            ","
                    17 Mar 2018
                ","Over the past decade, the number of foreign domestic workers (FDWs) in Singapore has increased by about 40%, to 240,000 in 2017. This was driven by demand from both households with and without caregiving needs.
Given Singapore’s limited resources, there is a need to manage the number of FDWs in Singapore, and at the same time, ensure that families who need help with caregiving are assisted.
No changes to levy for families with caregiving needs
Families with persons needing care will continue to enjoy the FDW concessionary levy rate of $60. There is no change to the levy rate. The Government will continue to support Singaporean households with children, elderly, and persons with disabilities.
Who qualifies for levy concession?
From 1 April 2019, Singaporean households will qualify for the levy concession if they have:
Age criteria to be raised from 65 years old in light of Singaporeans’ improving life expectancy and health. All households with persons aged 65 and 66, which are enjoying or have enjoyed the levy concession under the aged person scheme before 1 April 2019, will continue to pay the monthly levy rate of $60 on and after 1 April 2019.
Any family member who is certified as needing help or supervision with at least one activity of daily living (ADL) - eating, bathing, dressing, transferring, toileting and moving around.
For instance, a household looking after a family member with dementia can still qualify for the levy concession so long as he or she is a Singaporean and certified to require permanent help or supervision with a daily living activity. Such certification is available from a neighbourhood GP or a registered nurse/physiotherapist/occupational therapist.
Levy increase for families without caregiving needs
To reduce over reliance on FDWs, the Government will increase the FDW levy for employers without caregiving needs, from 1 April 2019. For employers who require help with household services such as home cleaning, engaging companies that provide such services may be a more sustainable solution. MOM had earlier piloted a Household Services Scheme to help meet increasing demand for such part-time household services.

                What is the Airport Development Levy and why should I pay for it?
            ","
                    02 Mar 2018
                ","The Ministry of Transport (MOT) and the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) announced on 28 February 2018 a new Airport Development Levy to fund the Changi Airport expansion project, or Changi East.

Factually explains why travellers have to pay the new Airport Development Levy, which goes towards funding the Changi East developments.

1.     Why must I pay for something that I am not using at the moment?

Infrastructure investments can be very lumpy, with hefty investments required upfront. The joint contribution model – by the Government, Changi Airport Group (CAG) and airport users – for the Changi East development prevents large spikes in charges that may be passed down to airport users in the future. This is not a new concept for airport infrastructure; airports in Hong Kong, Dubai and Qatar have similar models.

2.     Why can’t the Government pay for everything?

In general, airport users should bear their share for the use of airport facilities. Airport users have conventionally paid for the expansion or upgrading of airport facilities at Changi. The expansion of Terminal 1 and the construction of Terminal 4 were fully funded by aeronautical charges, such as the Passenger Service and Security Fee paid by airport users. 

Due to the strategic value of Changi East, the Government will pay the majority of the costs, while CAG will contribute the next largest share. Airport users’ contributions is the smallest share of a joint contribution model. If airport users are not to be charged, then the Government - meaning taxpayers - would have to pay more.

                    22 Feb 2018
                ","1. What is the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act (CLTPA) about?
The CLTPA provides for the maintenance of public safety, peace and good order. This is done through the detention and supervision of persons associated with activities of a criminal nature, via the issuance of Detention Orders (DOs) or Police Supervision Orders (PSOs). The powers under the Act have been used judiciously, and only in cases where prosecution in court was not possible, for example, when witnesses were unwilling to give evidence in court for fear of reprisals.
It has been used to deal swiftly and effectively with people associated with secret societies, as well as organised criminal groups such as drug trafficking and loansharking syndicates, among others. The Act has contributed to keeping such serious crimes under control, ensuring the safety and security of Singapore.
The CLTPA has been in force since 1955. The temporary nature of the CLTPA refers to the sunset clause which requires the Government to seek Parliament’s endorsement every five years, each time it wishes to have the CLTPA renewed.
2. Why use the CLTPA when there are legislations for those crimes?
Prosecuting offenders in court is always the preferred course of action. However, there are instances when court prosecution is not possible, such as when accomplices and witnesses are unwilling to testify in court for fear of reprisals. The CLTPA is thus used as a last resort against offenders in such instances.
3. What are the latest amendments made to the CLTPA?
The latest amendments to the CLTPA were passed in Parliament on 6 February 2018. Other than extending the CLTPA for another 5 years from 21 October 2019, other key amendments include the introduction of a new Fourth Schedule into the Act, which lists the types of criminal activities for which the Minister for Home Affairs can make orders for detention or Police supervision. Another key amendment was the codification in law that the Minister’s decisions on the issuance of orders are final.
4. Is this clause on the finality of the Minister’s decisions new? Does it take away judicial review?
The principles underlying the proposed clause in the CLTPA for the finality of the Minister’s decisions are not new. The Court of Appeal has held that Parliament can decide to entrust the power to the Minister to establish the facts of a case, apply those facts to the relevant rules and considerations, and exercise his discretion. The proposed clause is intended to crystallise this current position that the courts have already ruled on.
The finality clause and other amendments do not affect the courts’ power of judicial review. The courts still retain the power to review the Minister’s decisions under the CLTPA, based on the traditional tests of illegality, irrationality, and procedural impropriety.
5. What are the safeguards in place to prevent abuse of the CLTPA?
The CLTPA contains various safeguards. For example, the Public Prosecutor’s consent has to be obtained before any Detention Order (DO) or Police Supervision Order (PSO) is made, and every DO and PSO must be reviewed by an independent Criminal Law Advisory Committee, comprising prominent private citizens, including Justices of the Peace, former judges and senior lawyers, after which, it will make its recommendation to the President. From March 2018, the Criminal Law Advisory Committees, which review orders made by the Minister under sections 30 and 32, will be chaired by sitting Judges of the Supreme Court of Singapore. This will make the checks and balances in the CLTPA process even more robust.

                ","Several online articles have claimed that there has been a “secret CPF policy change” to increase the CPF Retirement Sum to S$181,000 by 2020. This is hardly a secret and was in fact publicly announced in 2015.
Contrary to the claim by these online articles, the 2015 announcement was widely reported by media outlets such as The Straits Times and TODAYOnline as well as online blogs such as MoneySmart. It was also published on MOM’s website and CPFB’s website to update CPF members on the announced changes.
In 2015, the Government accepted the CPF Advisory Panel’s recommendation for the Retirement Sums to increase by 3% every year for each cohort turning 55 from 2017 to 2020. This was to account for inflation, and some increase in expectations of successive cohorts of retirees for a higher standard of living.
Based on this, the Full Retirement Sum will rise to $181,000 by 2020, as shown in the table below. The Panel also suggested reviewing this rate of adjustment periodically to take into account more updated data on long-term inflation and retiree expenditures. 
The Government would never secretly increase Singaporeans’ CPF Retirement Sum.

Singaporeans can withdraw some of their CPF from age 55, even if they do not meet the Full Retirement Sum.
Some believe that Singaporeans are not allowed to withdraw their CPF if they cannot meet the Full Retirement Sum (previously known as the Minimum Sum). This is not true.
All members can withdraw up to $5,000 of their CPF unconditionally at age 55.
They can also withdraw their CPF savings above their Full Retirement Sum or above their Basic Retirement Sum if they own a property*.
In addition, when members reach the age when they are eligible for their first CPF retirement payout, they may withdraw a lump sum of up to 20% of their CPF savings (including the first $5,000 that can be withdrawn at age 55). This only applies to members who turn age 55 in 2013 or later.

                5 Things to Note About the Keppel Offshore and Marine Ltd Case
            ","
                    22 Feb 2018
                ","Keppel Offshore & Marine Ltd (KOM) is part of a Singaporean group of companies called Keppel Corporation. KOM’s corrupt payments to officials of a Brazilian oil company and other parties were brought to light in a joint release by the Attorney-General’s Chambers (AGC) and the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) in December 2017.
Here are 5 key things to note regarding the case so far.
1. KOM’s fine will not be paid by the Government
KOM has agreed to pay US$422 million (S$567 million) in fines as part of a global resolution with authorities in Singapore, Brazil and the United States. This penalty is about eight times the amount the company paid in bribes.
The fine will be paid fully by KOM to the respective governments. It will not come from the Government budget, nor impact Government revenue.
2. The Government has zero tolerance towards corruption
The Government does not condone or tolerate corruption. In Parliament on 8 January 2018, Senior Minister of State for Finance and Law Ms Indranee Rajah emphasised that the Government expects all Singapore companies, their officers and their employees to comply fully with the laws of Singapore and the laws of the jurisdictions in which they operate.
While Singapore companies have to operate in all kinds of environments, they must do so while keeping their systems clean, and complying with the laws of the countries where they operate. They must develop ways of operating which enable them to do this. They cannot lower their own standards of integrity, and they must not import corrupt practices into Singapore.
3. The Government has and will take people and companies to task for corruption
The Government has taken actions against people in the past, irrespective of their status. SMS Indranee cited the corruption bust at Singapore Technologies Marine (ST Marine) in 2014, and shared that as long as there is a “good reason to investigate, the authorities will do so whether or not the company is government-linked”.
For the case of ST Marine, at least S$24.9 million in bribes were falsely claimed as entertainment expenses and made to employees of ST Marine's customers in return for ship repair contracts. Seven former ST Marine senior executives were convicted in 2016 for their part in the graft scandal.
4. Role of Government in relation to Government-linked companies
The Government is not a direct shareholder of Keppel Corporation. It owns 100% of Temasek Holdings; Temasek in turn owns a minority stake of about 20% in Keppel Corporation, which owns 100% of KOM.
The Government does not interfere in, nor influence the business decisions or operations of Temasek or its portfolio companies. Likewise, Temasek does not interfere in the business decisions or operations of its portfolio companies. These are the responsibilities of the respective companies’ boards and management.
Temasek holds the boards of its portfolio companies responsible for running the companies honestly and competently. If the boards do not perform, Temasek can, collectively with other shareholders, change the board.
5. Status of investigations into individuals involved in KOM case
Investigations into the individuals involved in the corrupt payments are ongoing. The Singapore investigations are conducted on the same timeframe as the US and Brazilian investigations, and go back to 2001, when the corrupt acts first took place.
KOM itself has taken several remedial measures. This includes taking disciplinary action against 17 employees, parting company with seven employees and imposing millions in financial sanctions on 12 former employees as part of disciplinary actions.

This is in line with Prime Minister Lee’s speech at the PAP convention on 19 November 2017, where PM Lee said, “For this current term of government, we have enough revenue”. The government began its five-year term of office after the General Elections in Sep 2015. 
Nevertheless, as PM Lee explained in his speech, government spending has been going up. Planning for the issue now will allow us to better ease in the needed measures, and to give our people and businesses some time to adjust.
Any decision to raise taxes will not be taken lightly. But necessary investments in the future are needed. The Government has to remain forward-looking, and plan beyond this decade. But we will study all options carefully, and take steps with the least impact on the needy and on the economy.

Diabetes mellitus, commonly referred to as diabetes, is a long-term medical condition where our body’s blood glucose levels remain constantly higher than normal. It occurs when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the insulin is simply ineffective.
Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that controls the use of blood glucose (simple sugar) for energy. It plays an important role in keeping our blood glucose levels low.
Without insulin, our body will not be able to use or store the glucose that comes from food. The body will then use fat as a source of fuel for the body instead, which in turn will give rise to acute complications such as blindness and kidney failure.
Can I develop diabetes?
Here’s a quick breakdown on the two major types of diabetes:
Type 1 diabetes
This is the less common type between the two, often diagnosed in childhood. Type 1 diabetes is a type of condition where the body is unable to produce insulin due to a damaged pancreas. Although it can occur at any age, Type 1 diabetes is usually more common in children and young adults. Insulin is needed for treatment, and the complications can be sudden and life-threatening.
Type 2 diabetes 
This is the most common type of diabetes that affects most Singaporeans. In Type 2 diabetes, your body either becomes resistant to insulin or your pancreas does not produce enough insulin for your body.
You run a higher risk of developing Type 2 diabetes if you have an unhealthy lifestyle and diet.
How can I tell if I have diabetes?
Here are seven common symptoms of the disease:

Studies have shown that many who have been diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes did not even suspect they have the condition. A blood glucose test can detect diabetes, and screening is highly recommended to detect the chronic disease in its early stages.
I don’t think I’m at risk of diabetes...
Type 2 diabetes can occur in anyone, even younger adults and children.
You are at a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes if these apply to you:

If you are between 18-39 years old, you can take the online Diabetes Risk Assessment (DRA) to find out if you are at risk. Those who are assessed to be at risk of diabetes will be eligible for a government subsidy and need only pay S$5 for a full screening test.
For those above 40 years old, it is recommended that you go for cardiovascular risk screening (which includes diabetes) every three years.
Can diabetes be cured?
Diabetes cannot be cured but it can be controlled. Your blood glucose can be managed with proper diet and exercise if your diabetes is mild. However, if you have a more serious condition, oral medication or insulin injections will be required. For those who are overweight or obese, losing weight will reap significant benefits.

                ","Heard about the balloting for adjournment motions in Parliament recently? Factually finds out what an adjournment motion is, and why there is a need for balloting. 
But first, here’s a quick overview of how Parliament works.  
The Parliament of Singapore can meet (normally described as a ‘Sitting’) at any time of the year. Once a date is decided, or called by the Speaker, a notice will be sent to the Members of Parliament (MPs). 
MPs can send in notices of questions that they wish to ask the Ministers, amendments that they wish to propose to Bills already introduced, or issues which they want to discuss at the forthcoming sitting. All the items to be considered are printed in an Order Paper. 
The Order Paper will be dealt with during the first 1.5 hours, called ‘Question Time’. Any outstanding questions will be saved for written answers or postponed to a later sitting. At the end of a sitting day, a motion for the adjournment of Parliament is moved. This is essentially a call to end the sitting.
After the call to end the sitting is raised, any MP can still claim the right to raise additional matters of public concern. This is an Adjournment Motion. 
However, this right to raise matters is allotted to one MP per sitting. Should there be more than one MP claiming the right, the Adjournment Motion will be decided by ballot. 
Adjournment Motions have happened on occasion. A few recent Adjournment Motions are below:

            ","
                    26 Jan 2018
                ","Singapore has one of the busiest land checkpoints in the world, with approximately 400,000 people crossing the Tuas and Woodlands checkpoints daily. In order to safeguard our borders, especially in the current heightened security climate, the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) has put in place a Bioscreen system to capture the thumbprints of those arriving and departing from Singapore’s checkpoints. 
The system was first launched in April 2016, and progressively rolled out at our air, sea and land checkpoints. It has proven to be highly effective. From 25 September 2017, the BioScreen system was progressively extended to car travellers at the land checkpoints. 
Are all travellers subjected to fingerprint checks? 
The BioScreen system is being progressively rolled out as a trial at land checkpoints, so only selected car travellers aged six and above will be subjected to fingerprint checks. These travellers will need to step out of their car at the car counter in order to scan both thumbprints on the BioScreen machine. 
Will the BioScreen lead to congestion at the checkpoints?
ICA is mindful of the clearance time taken for each traveller, and will balance that with the need to ensure security at our checkpoints. ICA is monitoring the trial at the car zones closely, and will refine the process where necessary. In the meantime, ICA seeks the understanding and co-operation of travellers if they experience slightly longer immigration clearance time. 
Are there any travellers who will be exempted from the fingerprint checks, e.g. disabled persons or those with fading fingerprints?
Children below the age of six and persons whose fingerprints cannot be read need not undergo fingerprint checks. Travellers who have special needs and those with fingerprint issues will be assisted by ICA officers.

            ","
                    26 Jan 2018
                ","In his 2017 National Day Rally speech, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong quipped that Singapore trails behind other cities when it comes to electronic payments, and called for systems to be simplified and integrated. Factually takes a look at why e-payments are the way to go, and some of the upcoming plans.
Why e-payments?
E-payments make transactions simple, swift, and safe for both consumers and businesses. With e-payments, the digitisation of business processes will be boosted, which in turn can enhance productivity, reduce costs, and create new business models for companies in the digital economy.
What are our plans for e-payments?
A new funds transfer service – PayNow – was recently launched. You can use PayNow to instantly pay friends and family with only their mobile numbers or NRIC/FIN details - so there’s no need to put in bank and account numbers any more!
The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the banks are working with industry players to simplify e-payments acceptance by merchants. This will involve the deployment of Unified-Point-of-Sales terminals across the island. 25,000 such terminals are expected to be rolled out over the next 18 months. 
For merchants who prefer an infrastructure-light and less costly solution, there are plans to develop a common QR code for Singapore (SGQR code). This will make it even easier for consumers and small businesses to do/accept small value payments across different payment schemes, e-wallets, and banks.
Can the overall costs and charges of e-payments be lowered?
MAS and the banking industry are working to extend PayNow to merchants and companies. In addition, the SGQR code, when implemented, will provide merchants with a cheaper alternative to accept different types of e-payments.
How to use PayNow
PayNow is available to customers of Citibank, DBS Bank/POSB, HSBC, Maybank, OCBC Bank, Standard Chartered Bank and United Overseas Bank. Simply register for PayNow at any participating banks via their websites or mobile apps. You will need to link your bank account to either your mobile number or NRIC/FIN number.
Once you have registered for PayNow, it is time to start using it! Here are three simple steps to get started:
Step 1: Login to your banking website or mobile banking app
Step 2: Enter the recipient’s mobile number or NRIC/FIN number and the amount you wish to transfer
Step 3: Verify the name of the recipient and confirm your payment amount!
That’s it! At the end of the transaction, both you and the recipient will receive instant notifications of the transfer.

Health,Brown rice vs White Rice: What's the difference?,/factually/content/brown-rice-vs-white-rice-whats-the-difference,"
                Brown rice vs White Rice: What's the difference?
            ","
                    05 Feb 2018
                ","During the 2017 National Day Rally, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong spoke at length about the war on diabetes and encouraged Singaporeans to eat right, exercise more, and go for health check-ups. On eating right, PM Lee suggested making small changes such as replacing white rice with brown or mixed grain race when we cook at home.

So what exactly is the problem with white rice? And why is brown rice considered the healthier alternative? We show you some grains of truth concerning this rice-ing issue.

Is brown rice better than white rice?

While white and brown rice contain similar amounts of energy, carbohydrates and protein, brown rice has a higher amount of vitamins and minerals. It also contains five times more fibre and twice the amount of iron.

Besides nutritional value, brown rice also has a lower Glycaemic Index (GI) value when compared to white rice. The higher the GI, the faster and more the food raises blood glucose after eating. 

Why does Glycaemic Index (GI) matter?

Research has shown that eating high GI foods can lead to an increased risk for Type 2 diabetes, heart disease, obesity and colorectal cancer.

White rice, for example, is in the high GI range of 70 to 100; while brown rice is in the medium GI range of 56 to 69.

Why is brown rice more expensive? Shouldn’t it be cheaper since there’s less processing involved?

With a higher demand for white rice, it is produced in larger quantities and leads to better economies of scale. Thus, brown rice is currently seen as a premium product and is more expensive. The small amount of oil in the bran layer also gives brown rice a shorter shelf-life compared to white rice. This increases the cost of transport and storage of brown rice. When there is an increased demand for brown rice, prices are likely to fall.

Tips on cooking and storing brown rice

For the current and aspiring home cooks out there, here is some additional information on how to choose and cook brown rice:

Selection: Brown rice comes in short, medium, and long grain. If you prefer your rice to be light and fluffy, go for the long grain option. If you like yours chewy and tender, the medium and short grain options are best. 

Cooking: The process of cooking brown rice is similar to white rice, with the extra step of soaking the rice prior to cooking.

For brown rice, soak the rice for half an hour before cooking. The water ratio for brown rice is two cups of water for every cup of brown rice. The cooking time for brown rice is approximately 35 to 40 minutes. Brown rice-friendly rice cookers tend to indicate the specific amount of water for brown rice, so follow the directions of the rice cooker for the best results. 

If going full-on brown rice is a bit too much for you, you can always try replacing a portion of white rice (about 20%) as a start. 

Storing: If uncooked, store the brown rice in pest-proof containers with lids. Uncooked brown rice can be stored at room temperature for around six months. To prolong shelf-life, store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator. 

If the rice is cooked, you would need to cool the freshly-cooked rice within an hour after cooking. Once cooled, the rice should be put in a covered contained in the fridge at a temperature below 8°C. Do not keep for more than two days or reheat it more than once.

Are there other healthy rice options?

Of course, brown rice isn’t the only healthier option. You can find out more about the different varieties of rice below.

Rice varieties 



White rice (also known as polished rice) refers to rice which has its hull, bran and germ removed. Since the bran contains a small amount of oil which can turn rancid, the rice is polished to extend its shelf-life. 

Brown rice refers to rice that is unpolished where only the hull is removed but the germ and bran are retained. It contains almost five times the fibre and two times the iron of white rice.

Red rice contains anthocyanins that give its bran a red/maroon colour. Compared to brown rice, it contains a similar amount of fibre but twice the amount of iron and six times the amount of zinc.  

Black rice has a black coloured bran layer due to its unique anthocyanin combination. These anthocyanins cause black rice to turn into a deep purple colour when cooked. Compared to brown rice, it has three times the fibre, and requires less cooking time. 

Purple rice is a short grain variant of black rice. It is purple in its uncooked state and deep purple when cooked. It contains a similar amount of fibre but twice the iron and four times the zinc of brown rice.

Under Singapore’s laws, employers face penalties such as fines, jail terms and permanent debarment from hiring FDWs if they do not provide adequate food. The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) has taken such employers to task in the past.
Over 97% say they have sufficient food
With laws in place to ensure their well-being, the majority of FDWs are happy working here. From MOM’s surveys, over 97% of FDWs also said that they had sufficient food to eat every day.
Voice concerns early
The NGO article claimed that FDWs who filed food-related complaints to MOM lost their jobs and were sent home. This is also not true.
Of the small number of FDWs who approach MOM for assistance with food problems, most have already left their jobs of their own accord before filing the complaint. Usually the complaints are the result of misunderstandings between the FDW and her employer. Sometimes the FDWs don't like the food provided; sometimes they are not used to the type of meals consumed in their employers’ households.
FDWs need to make adjustments in many areas when they are new in employment, and food is one of them. Those who have concerns should voice these with their employers so that issues can be sorted out amicably. Employers are also encouraged to be more sensitive and mindful of their FDWs’ needs, and ask about what they typically eat.
Assistance channels
FDWs who have employment issues may contact MOM’s helpline at 1800 339 5505 or call the Centre for Domestic Employees at 1800 225 5233.
If you have concerns about the well-being of an FDW, please contact MOM at mom_fmmd@mom.gov.sg so that they can follow up on it. Please do not post speculations online without first verifying them.

                ","1. Why not just appoint the President?
The President should not be appointed by the Government, as he/she serves as a check on the Government.
Besides serving as a unifying figure for Singaporeans of all races, the President has responsibilities pertaining to Singapore’s reserves.
While the Government holds the “first key” to Singapore’s reserves, the Constitution gives the President the “second key” — the authority to veto measures taken by the Government which requires drawing on past reserves. If the President is appointed by the Government, he/she may not be able to exercise his/her authority independently without being influenced by the Government.
This is why the President has to be elected by the citizens of Singapore. This will give him/her the mandate and legitimacy to check the elected Government, and be an effective custodian of Singapore’s reserves.

2. Can I run for President?
The upcoming Presidential Election will be reserved for candidates from the Malay community.
A Malay Community Sub-Committee will assess if you can consider yourself to be a member of the Malay community, and if you are generally accepted as a member by the Malay community.

3. Do I need to vote in the Presidential Election?
Voting is compulsory for all Singaporeans, and you should exercise your right and responsibility to elect the President.
If you fail to vote, you will not be able to vote or stand as a candidate at any subsequent Presidential or Parliamentary election, until your name is restored to the registers. You will have to submit an application to the Elections Department (ELD) to restore your name and explain why you did not vote in the election. A $50 fee will be imposed if you do not have a valid reason for not voting.

                ","Have you been affected by a train service delay caused by a signalling fault, and wondered what that was about? Factually explains.
What is this signalling system?
Train signalling systems are used to direct railway traffic while ensuring trains run according to schedule, and keep a safe distance from one another. They are complex systems, similar to the central nervous system in our body, which coordinates our movements.
Why change the system?
The signalling system used on the North-South and East-West Lines is old. It has been in use since 1987 — 30 years ago! That is why we are replacing it with a newer, more technologically advanced and robust system.
How will the new signalling system benefit me as a commuter?
The new signalling system will allow us to run trains closer to each other. A train will arrive every 100 seconds during peak hours, compared to every 120 seconds now.
When the rail lines fully transit to the new signalling system, commuters will experience:
Overall, our train journeys will be more comfortable.
6 facts about the new signalling system on the North-South MRT Line (#NSL) you might not realise.
When will the new signalling system be installed?
The new signalling system has been installed for the North-South Line (NSL). Full-day tests are now being conducted to ensure its efficiency and reliability.
Installation works are still on-going for the East-West Line (EWL), and these are only done at night after passenger service hours.
Why must the new signalling system be tested all day, including during peak hours?
Testing the new signalling system under actual conditions is crucial as it is an iterative process, allowing problems to be surfaced, analysed and fixed quickly. This is unlike new lines where we can extensively test the system before the lines open.
For NSL, however, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) and SMRT did not have the option to suspend it for a few years for testing as many commuters depend on it. To minimise inconvenience to commuters, LTA and SMRT adopted a phased approach. They started testing the new system on NSL in 2016, first during non-passenger service hours, then during off-peak and Sundays, before finally launching full-day weekday runs in May 2017 during passenger service hours.
Tests for the new signalling system on EWL during passenger service hours are expected to commence gradually during the upcoming December school holidays to minimise inconvenience. LTA and SMRT expect the EWL’s transition to the new signalling system to be smoother after valuable lessons from testing it on NSL.
I have been affected by service delays for many weeks. When will the signalling system tests stop?
LTA and SMRT are doing their best. (In cities like London and Taipei, engineers and specialists took many months for their re-signalling projects too).
LTA and SMRT recently introduced a software update for the new signalling system on NSL to address the teething issues. Progress on the NSL thus far has been good and they are confident that the system will stabilise before the end of the year.

                ","In Singapore, we have a retirement age, and a re-employment age. Factually explains.
Retirement Age
Our minimum retirement age is 62 years old. This means that employers are not allowed to dismiss any employee below 62 because of the employee’s age.
Re-employment Age
From 1 July 2017, employers must offer re-employment to eligible employees who turn 62, up to the age of 67. This provides older workers with more opportunities to work longer, if they wish to do so, while at the same time having the choice to retire when they have reached 62.
You are eligible for re-employment up to age 67 if you:
• are a Singapore citizen or Singapore permanent resident
• have served your current employer for at least 3 years before turning 62
• have satisfactory work performance, as assessed by your employer
• are medically fit to continue working
• were born on or after 1 July 1952.
Things to note if you’re considering re-employment:
• While negotiating a re-employment contract with your employer, make your job preferences known early in the consultation process.
• Keep an open mind about possible changes to your current job arrangement or employment terms.
• If you are eligible for re-employment but the employer is unable to offer you a position, then the employer must offer you Employment Assistance Payment (EAP) after a thorough review and as a last resort.
You should work together with your employer or union to resolve any differences. You can also approach the Commissioner for Labour or the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management if you:
• are not offered re-employment
• encounter unreasonable terms and conditions, or EAP amount.

                    06 Feb 2018
                ","#Didyouknow? The Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-city is a bilateral project between Singapore and China. The project provides a platform for our countries to explore new collaborations and ideas, and share best practices in sustainable urbanisation.
Here are 3 more things you may not know:
 

1. It is thrice the size of Sengkang
The entire project spans 30 km2 — about three times the size of Sengkang. So far, an 8 km2 start-up area in the south has largely been completed. 
The project is located within the Tianjin Binhai New Area (TBNA), on the coast of the Bohai Sea, and is part of the Bohai Economic Rim. TBNA is a Special Economic Zone and is a new growth area in China. 
 


2. The Singapore Government does not fund the Eco-city’s infrastructure development
A local Chinese Government authority oversees the project with a master developer – the Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-city Investment and Development Company Limited, which is a 50-50 joint venture between a Singapore consortium led by Keppel Group and a Chinese consortium led by Tianjin TEDA Investment Company Limited.
Singapore contributes to the project through the sharing of professional expertise and experience. Our experts from various agencies, such as URA, NParks, NEA, PUB, HDB and BCA, have been working closely with their Chinese counterparts in the planning and development of the Eco-city. Experts from both countries have gained professionally from the mutual sharing.

3. This is what it looks like (before and after)

Before the site broke ground in 2008, it comprised mainly saltpans, non-arable land and polluted water-bodies. Today1, this land is a green and vibrant city with over 70,000 people living and working there, served by a range of social amenities. There are also about 4,500 registered companies in the Eco-city with a total registered capital of RMB 200 billion.

                Quality vs Value: How does Government evaluate tenders?
            ","
                    05 Feb 2018
                ","The Singapore Government has a one-stop e-procurement portal named GeBIZ — short for Government Electronic Business (GeBIZ). The GeBIZ portal provides suppliers with equal opportunities to participate in the public sector’s Invitations To Quote or Tender.

How does the Government ensure that procurement is as fair as possible? We bust three myths about GeBIZ.

Myth 1: SMEs are disadvantaged when bidding for Government contracts

Government procurements are guided by the principles of transparency, open and fair competition, and value-for-money. Government agencies are expected to evaluate all bids submitted by eligible suppliers fairly, regardless of the size of the firm. Agencies also try to ensure that tenders are appropriately sized to give all suppliers – including SMEs – a chance to compete for them.

SMEs have been reasonably successful in securing Government contracts under the open procurement system. Data from the Ministry of Finance shows that SMEs have captured more than 50% of total Government contract value and around 80% of all Government contracts. More than 40% of total contracts were won by companies with revenue of less than S$10 million.

Myth 2: The lowest bidder always wins

This is not true. While suppliers’ bids are evaluated on their value for money, it does not mean contracts are always awarded to the lowest quote.

While price is a key consideration in evaluation, Government agencies check if bids have complied with all the requirements in the tender specifications, as well as evaluate other factors such as quality of the goods and services, timeliness in delivery, reliability, and after-sales support. 

Roughly half of all procurements are not awarded to the lowest quote.

Myth 3: The Government always favours local companies

As Singapore is a signatory to the World Trade Organization Agreement on Government Procurement, as well as a number of free trade agreements, the Government is obliged to be non-discriminatory in our procurement practices. 

So where procurements are covered under these agreements, the Government cannot discriminate in favour of or against local companies, and other countries who have similar agreements with us cannot discriminate against Singapore companies.

            ","
                    29 Jun 2018
                ","The GST Voucher (GSTV) is a permanent scheme introduced by the Government in 2012 to help lower-income Singaporeans with their expenses. The GSTV is given in 3 components – Cash, Medisave and U-Save.
In Budget 2017, the Government announced that GSTV – Cash recipients would receive a one-off special payment of up to $200 on top of the regular Cash payment. In total, about 1.57 million eligible Singaporeans would receive a total of $1.2 billion worth of GST Vouchers and Medisave Top-Ups in 2017. Eligible HDB households would also receive higher U-Save rebates from Jul 2017.
Do I qualify?
Confused by the different criteria for the GST Vouchers? Here’s a quick and simple guide for you.
GST Voucher – Cash
For a start, in order to qualify for GSTV – Cash this year, you must first be a Singapore citizen, staying in Singapore. You must also be aged 21 or above.
Next, your income earned in 2015 (as assessed by IRAS for the Year of Assessment 2016) must not exceed $28,000.
Also, the annual value of your home [1] must not be above $21,000 as of 31 December 2016. You must also not own more than one property.
If you satisfy all of the above requirements, you qualify. So how much do you get? The amount of Cash and Special Payment you get depends on the annual value of your home. See below:

GST Voucher – Medisave
Besides GSTV – Cash, if you are a Singapore citizen aged 65 and above and staying in Singapore, you may also receive GSTV – Medisave.
As with the Cash component, the annual value of your home must not exceed $21,000 as of 31 December 2016, and you must not own more than one property.
If you meet the above criteria, the amount of GSTV – Medisave top-up you receive will depend on your age in 2017 and the annual value of your home. See below:

In addition to the above, if you are aged 58 years and above and do not receive Pioneer Generation benefits, you will receive a Medisave top-up in both 2017 and 2018. The amount of top-ups depends on your age.
Pioneers will also receive Pioneer Generation Medisave top-ups of $200 to $800, depending on their age.

GST Voucher – U-Save
Lastly, eligible households will also receive GSTV – U-Save, which is credited to their utilities account. To qualify, your family must first stay in a HDB flat, and there must be at least one Singapore citizen owner, occupier or tenant in your HDB flat.
In addition, immediate family members living in the same HDB flat must not own or have any interest in more than one property.
The amount of U-Save you get depends on your HDB flat type. Each eligible household will receive the U-Save distributed every 3 months, as shown in the table below.

You will also receive a one-off Service & Conservancy Charges rebate in 2017. This amount will vary according to your HDB flat type:

Doing more for the environment – mobile SMS notifications
If you have previously signed up for the GSTV or any other government payout scheme, you will automatically receive your GSTV payouts. For those who have not signed up, you will have until 31 December 2017 to sign up through the GSTV website (www.gstvoucher.gov.sg), or through a hardcopy form (found at Community Centres).
This year, if you have updated your mobile number with SingPass, you would have received SMS notifications about your GST Voucher – Cash and Medisave eligibility from 27 to 29 June. This is faster and more convenient, and eco-friendly as well. The sender of the SMS would be ""GSTV"", and the SMS would request that you log into www.gstvoucher.gov.sg with your SingPass details to view the benefits. However, beware of phishing websites, which may ask you for personal information without SingPass authentication.

If you are aged 21 to 55 with mobile numbers updated with SingPass, you will only receive SMS notifications (without hardcopy letters). If you are 56 and above with mobile numbers updated with SingPass, you will receive both SMSes and notification letters. You can opt for SMS notifications in future by updating your mobile numbers with SingPass at www.singpass.gov.sg.

[1] The AV is the estimated annual rent a property can fetch if it were to be rented out. It is used to calculate the property tax of your home. The AV can be found on the property tax bill that the property owner receives each year. The AV threshold of $21,000 covers all HDB flats and some lower-value private properties, as the GST Voucher targets those who are less well-off.

                ","The terrorism threat to Singapore remains the highest in recent years. As it is a multi-faceted and serious issue, we need to continue to be vigilant and guard against the threat of radicalisation and terrorism. While our security agencies will do their best, we should also realise that everyone has a part to play. 
Here are three points you should know:
1. Radicalisation can happen to anyone, across all races and religions. 
No one is immune from the radicalisation that we see happening around the world, and Singaporeans are just as susceptible to becoming radicalised.
2. Be vigilant. 
If you notice your family or friends behaving suspiciously or showing signs of radicalisation^, you must take a stand and alert the relevant authorities. Doing so will help save your loved ones from harming themselves and others.
3. Contact relevant authorities promptly. 
If you have information or suspicions regarding radicalised behaviour, contact the ISD Counter-Terrorism Centre hotline 1800-2626-473 (1800-2626-ISD) so that the affected person(s) can be steered away from radicalism or even terrorism.
We should always stand together to safeguard our multi-racial, multi-religious and multi-cultural society as one united nation. We must come forward to condemn acts of violence as a community, and not let the actions of a few extremists mar our social fabric and bonds. Let’s remain vigilant to prevent an attack on our home and our way of life.
^Signs of radicalism may include, but are not limited to, avid consumption of radical materials; propagating and re-posting terrorism-related images, videos and posts; expressing support for terrorist entities; and encouraging others or stating an intention to commit terrorist violence.

This new rumour is, in fact, a variation of another false claim that surfaced in 2012, which had already been debunked back then. 
Here are a few more things you need to know about CPF nomination.
What exactly is a CPF nomination?
A CPF nomination provides CPF members with the option to specify who will receive their CPF savings, and how much each nominee should receive, upon their demise. If a CPF nomination is not made, the deceased member’s CPF savings will be transferred to the Public Trustee’s Office (PTO) for distribution to his or her family members under the Intestate Succession Act, or the Inheritance Certificate (for Muslims).

            ","
                    06 Feb 2018
                ","With a Presidential Election on the horizon this September, there has been renewed interest in the powers that the President of Singapore has. Here’s a summary of the President’s discretionary powers:
Discretionary powers
Prior to 30 November 1991, the role of the President was largely a ceremonial one. However, the Constitution was amended to make the President’s office an elected office with discretionary powers relating to the safeguarding of national reserves, and the protection of the integrity of the Public Service.
The President has the power to veto or disagree with the Government’s proposals in the following areas:
• All fiscal matters touching on Singapore’s reserves
• All matters relating to key appointments in the public service and Fifth Schedule entities
• Restraining Orders under the Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act
• Continued detention under the Internal Security Act
• Refusal of investigations by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau
Consultation with advisers
The President must consult the Council of Presidential Advisers (CPA) on all fiscal matters touching on Singapore’s reserves and on the appointment and removal of key office holders in the public service and Fifth Schedule entities. On other areas involving the President’s discretionary powers, consultation of CPA is optional.
If the President vetoes any fiscal matter touching on Singapore’s reserves or the appointment/removal of any key office holder in the public service or Fifth Schedule entity, and the President’s decision is contrary to CPA’s advice, Parliament may overrule the President’s decision with a two-thirds majority vote.
Ceremonial and community roles
Besides the powers granted by the Constitution, the President also has ceremonial and community roles:
Ceremonial: As the Ceremonial Head of State, the President is the symbolic figure representing Singapore at ceremonies and internationally.
Community: The President may use the influence of his position to support charitable and social causes, such as sports, volunteerism, social entrepreneurship, culture and the arts. The President's Challenge championed by the President is one such example.

Environment,Why increase water prices?,/factually/content/why-increase-water-prices,"
                Why increase water prices?
            ","
                    28 Jun 2018
                ","Water is fundamental to our survival
Water is a scarce and precious resource in Singapore.
We depend on rain as a natural source of water. We receive plenty of rain, but we are constrained by our land area, which limits our storage space for water. We do not have large rivers, natural springs and glaciers to draw water from.
Our founding Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew recognised early on that water would be fundamental to Singapore’s survival. That was why he ensured the water agreements Singapore had with Johor were enshrined in the Separation Agreement, which was subsequently lodged in the United Nations.

Our four taps
Since our independence, ensuring that we will always have enough water has been a priority, and a matter of national security. We have expended a lot of effort, ingenuity and resources into ensuring our water security over the years. As a result, we get our water from four national taps today, as opposed to only two in 1965:
1) Our own reservoirs
2) Imported water (Johor River)
3) NEWater
4) Desalination.
Still, we cannot take any of our taps and our supply for granted. Under our 1962 Water Agreement with Johor, we are entitled to draw up to 250 million gallons (mgd) from the Johor River each day. That agreement will expire in 2061.
In the 1990s, we built a reservoir (Linggiu Reservoir) in Johor to regulate the flow of water from the Johor River. Water from the reservoir is released into the Johor River to supplement its yield, especially during dry weather, so that we can still draw up to 250 mgd. But last year, the water level in Linggiu Reservoir fell to a historic low of 20%. The reservoir may run out of water if there is prolonged dry weather.

Increasing costs of supplying water
Water should not become a vulnerability for Singapore. We must continue to invest in and upgrade our water system to make it more resilient. One particular emergent concern is the effect of climate change on our water supply.
In the meantime, the costs of producing water and maintaining our water infrastructure are rising. In 2000, our water system cost around $500 million to operate. By 2015, the cost had risen to $1.3 billion. PUB expects to spend another $4 billion on water infrastructure from 2017 to 2021. This will include investments in NEWater and desalination factories, pipelines and pumping stations, and water reclamation plants.
Revision in water prices needed
A revision of our water prices is needed to meet the higher costs of treating and supplying water. We also need to price water properly because it is a scarce resource that is not cheap to produce.
Our water prices will be revised in two phases, on 1 July 2017 and 1 July 2018. To lessen the impact of the price revision, the Government will increase the annual GST Voucher – U-Save rebate for eligible HDB households.
After the rebates, 75% of HDB households will see an increase of less than $12 a month. One- and two-room HDB households will on average see no increase. Three- and four-room HDB households will on average see an increase of about $2 and $5 a month respectively.
Make every drop count
Water continues to be crucial to our safety and existence. Despite all the effort we have put in, we will never have more than enough water. It is a constant challenge for PUB to supply sufficient water to meet the growing needs of our households and industries.
Save water where you can, and make every drop count.

                ","Breast milk is best for babies. But if you need to use formula milk, here’s what you should know.
Price does not indicate quality
All infant milk formula sold in Singapore provide sufficient basic nutrition for infants to grow healthily. There is little difference in the key nutrients offered by different brands of milk.
While some brands offer higher levels of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in their milk, more is not necessarily better. Studies on the benefits of increased amounts of DHA have not been conclusive. Also, the more expensive brands may not have higher levels of DHA than cheaper brands. 
More important to build a balanced diet 
Once your child is six months old, you should focus on weaning him and moving him slowly to a solid food diet that is balanced and nutritious. 
There are plenty of foods you can introduce at this stage to provide your growing child with protein and other nutrients he needs. There is in fact more DHA in fish such as as ikan bilis, batang (Spanish mackerel) and salmon than in premium formula milk.
Delaying the introduction of solid food to your child can lead to problems like fussy eating and developmental issues. 
Once your child is one year old, you can give him regular cow’s milk (instead of formula milk), as part of a balanced diet. 
The tables below provide details on food groups and servings recommended by the Health Promotion Board.

The National Environment Agency (NEA) is assisting SRHZ users who want to continue selling their goods at temporary flea markets to take up stalls in flea markets close to their homes.
It has also set aside more than 30 hawker stalls for those who are interested to continue their trade elsewhere. So far, 23 users have submitted applications for hawker stalls, and 20 of them have been allocated lock-up stalls to date, at Chinatown Market, North Bridge Road Market and Food Centre and Upper Cross Street Market. These are in addition to the stalls made available under NEA's monthly tender for hawker stalls. NEA is guiding the users through the application process and facilitating their applications.
NEA is offering 11 permit holders the option of operating at lock-up stalls at selected hawker centres at subsidised rental rates.
Employment assistance 
Workforce Singapore (WSG) is providing employment assistance to SRHZ users who are eligible. Forty-one hawkers responded to WSG’s offer to help.  As of 11 May, WSG is providing job placement support to three users. The remaining users have either not made a decision about alternative employment or indicated that they do not need employment assistance from WSG. WSG will continue to follow up with them after the closure of the SHRZ. 
Financial assistance 
The Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) Social Service Offices (SSO) have been reaching out to SRHZ users who have indicated that they require financial assistance. As of 11 May, 15 users have applied for and been granted ComCare assistance.
MSF is also working with Central Singapore CDC to match users who require further help to other assistance schemes.
Some users have stated that they do not require any assistance and have indicated that they are able to support themselves or find other jobs on their own. Nonetheless, the agencies will continue to engage them, and provide them with assistance options should they wish to take any up.




More information on Assistance Schemes
SRHZ users who require more information on employment assistance can visit any of the WSG or e2i Career Centres, or call 6883 5885 (WSG) or 6474 0606 (e2i). The centres’ locations and contact details can be found at: www.wsg.gov.sg/career-services.html.

            ","
                    06 Feb 2018
                ","There were recent reports of “fake eggs” being sold at a coffee shop in Ang Mo Kio. The reports claimed that the eggs seemed lumpy and unlike the normal eggs we usually have in Singapore.
But no worries. The Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority of Singapore (AVA) has inspected the eggs from the shop. It has verified that the eggs were real and were imported from an AVA-accredited farm in Malaysia.
Here are some “eggs-citing” facts about eggs in Singapore:
1) Most of our imported eggs come from Malaysia. The other countries approved to export fresh table eggs to Singapore are: Australia, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, Sweden and the United States.
2) All eggs in Singapore, whether imported or locally produced, are regularly sampled to ensure they are safe and meet AVA’s standards and requirements.
3) Eggs sold in local markets are individually labelled with a code to identify the producing farm.
4) The AVA has introduced a scheme to ensure local farms produce quality eggs that are fresh – it’s called the Singapore Quality Egg Scheme (SQES). The farms undergo monthly inspections by AVA officers to ensure that the farm facilities are hygienic, and that quality control systems are well-maintained. The AVA also conducts scientific egg freshness tests in laboratories.
5) Real eggs comprise an egg shell on the outside, and membranes surrounding the white and yolk of the egg within the shell. At the wider end of the egg, there is also an air pocket. After cracking, the egg yolk and white should remain separate and not mix, unless stirred. When raw, the texture of eggs should be runny. Both the egg white and yolk will gradually solidify when cooked.
For details on the SQES, go to http://www.ava.gov.sg/explore-by-sections/farms/farming-initiatives/singapore-quality-egg-scheme

                What are the reasons behind the increase in ComCare numbers?
            ","
                    06 Feb 2018
                ","There are a number of online articles claiming that poverty in Singapore has reached its worst levels, as more families are receiving ComCare. This isnot true. 

The number of households on ComCare assistance has been increasing since 2012, and this is due to several factors. 

Extended coverage of assistance and increased accessibility of help

In recent years, the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) has progressively strengthened our social safety nets and extended the coverage of assistance to more families. Since 2014, the Ministry has increased the monthly household income cap for families seeking Short-to-Medium Term Assistance (SMTA) from $1,700 to $1,900, and the cap on income per person was raised from $550 to $650. This means that more can apply for help.

In 2013, MSF started rolling out a network of Social Service Offices (SSOs) to provide more accessible and coordinated social assistance to Singaporeans in need. There are now 24 SSOs island-wide, serving specific HDB towns, making help more accessible to vulnerable families.

Changing profile of households seeking assistance

The demographic profile in Singapore has also been changing, and we are seeing trends such as shrinking family sizes and an ageing population.

While there is an increasing number of young households under ComCare SMTA, the percentage of ComCare SMTA households whose main applicant is younger than 35 years old has fallen from 19.5% in FY2012 to 19.1% in FY2015. 

There are more  households headed by older persons on ComCare, increasing from 11.7% in FY2012 to 13.7% in FY2015. 

What is ComCare?

ComCare Short-to-Medium Term Assistance (SMTA) provides social assistance for low-income individuals and families, who are temporarily unable to work (e.g. due to illness and caregiving responsibilities) or who need temporary financial support while they seek employment. The SSO officer will assess the family’s situation, and may provide assistance such as cash grants or assistance with household bills. The amount and duration of support will depend on the household’s needs and circumstances. Our officers also partner Workforce Singapore (WSG) and the Employment and Employability Institute (e2i) to provide clients with employment assistance, or link clients up with community partners to address other family issues. 

ComCare Long Term Assistance (also known as the Public Assistance scheme) is targeted at the most needy who are unable to work due to old age, illness or disability, have limited or no means of income, and have little or no family support. The support given includes monthly cash assistance, free medical treatment in polyclinics and government/restructured hospitals and access to government-funded social services such as Senior Activity Centres and befriending services. Recipients may also receive additional assistance for recurring healthcare or hygiene needs, or one-off purchases of essential items. Since 1 July 2016, a one-person household can receive cash assistance of $500 per month (up from $450).

                Why is the Ministry of Education merging some schools? 
            ","
                    06 Feb 2018
                ","The Ministry of Education (MOE) recently announced that 14 primary schools, six secondary schools, and eight junior colleges will be paired and merged in 2019. One new primary school will be opened in Sengkang in 2018.
Here are answers to eight questions you may have regarding the school mergers. For the latest updates on schools, head over to MOE.


1. Why are schools and JCs being merged? 
School mergers are necessary for our students’ benefit. Schools with low enrolment find it challenging to offer a wide range of subject combinations, educational programmes and co-curricular activities (CCAs).
For example, schools have had to stop offering some CCAs which did not have enough students to form teams. Other CCA groups which continued without a full team were unable to participate in some programmes or competitions. The mergers will provide our schools with the healthy enrolment needed to continue to provide a rich variety of learning programmes and experiences for our students.
Declining birth rates will also lead to a corresponding decline in students entering post-secondary institutions. We will see a fall in demand of around 3,200 JC places between 2010 and 2019, with the sharpest year-on-year drop expected in 2018 and 2019. In fact, it will likely continue to drop in 2020 before stabilising for the foreseeable future. If no action is taken by MOE, this fall in cohort sizes will result in low enrolment across all JCs in the long term.
It would be untenable for MOE to continue to hold off from merging any JCs when we will have cumulatively a drop of about 3,200 JC1 places by 2019.   


2. What is considered ‘critical mass’ or sufficient enrolment? 
Sufficient enrolment in a school differs from school to school, depending on the type of educational programmes offered. Our primary and secondary schools can usually take up to about 1,300 or 1,400 students based on the infrastructure provided, but we typically operate at slightly below that for most schools.
For most JCs, the enrolment would be about 1,600. Actual enrolment figures will also depend on other factors such as overall cohort sizes, demographic shifts, students' choice of educational pathways, etc. From experience, it is not an issue if enrolment is about 200 - 400 below those numbers. But if enrolment goes well below that, then it would generally start to have some impact on the educational experience of the students.   
Schools with low enrolments would not have the critical mass to offer a range of curricular and co-curricular learning programmes. It would be challenging to provide an enriching education experience for students in such low enrolment schools.


3. Why not just keep the low-enrolment schools but reduce class sizes across the board?
The classroom experience is only one aspect of a student’s experience in school. Regardless of class sizes, schools with low enrolment will still find it challenging to offer a wide range of subject combinations, educational programmes and co-curricular activities (CCAs). The mergers will provide our schools with the healthy enrolment needed to offer a rich variety of learning programmes and experiences for a holistic development of our students.
As a system, we have reduced class sizes in a selective and targeted manner, by reducing to 20 for most of the Normal (Technical) classes, and by reducing to below 10, even as low as four in some cases, for those with learning difficulties or need special support to level up their school-readiness. This allows the schools to conduct literacy and numeracy support programmes in smaller class sizes of eight to 10 at the primary level to provide more focused support for weaker students. For subjects like Design & Technology and Food & Consumer Education, where students may be required to operate machinery or equipment, as well as most N(T) classes, the class size is usually 20.
We call this needs-based resourcing, where we take a student-centric approach to meet the needs of the students or to ensure effective programme delivery. We have chosen to do things which are targeted and focused on needs of our students, to optimise our limited manpower resources.


4. Is MOE doing this just to save money for the Government?
The primary driver for mergers is not cost but the quality of the school experience, i.e. range of education programmes, CCAs, subject combinations, overall environment.
If the schools are not merged in 2019, more schools would have low enrolment, which would negatively impact the range of education programmes and CCAs that could be provided for our students. Ultimately, the overall student experience will become a poorer one, and this is exactly what MOE aims to avoid.
There are some cost savings when we merge schools – most of this would be in the form of fixed overheads such as the school leadership and administrative team, infrastructure maintenance costs, etc. MOE has to be prudent in how we manage costs and, ultimately, we have to be good stewards of public funds, so that every dollar of our spending achieves the most in developing our students and achieving good student outcomes.
Nonetheless, we do not make decisions on school mergers with the aim of achieving a cost savings target or to maximise cost-effectiveness. Otherwise, we would have gone for far more school mergers and ensured all schools operate at close to their planned or optimal capacity for maximum cost-effectiveness outcomes.  


5. Why not merge a low-enrolment Government school with a Government-Aided school? Why merge only eight non-IP Government JCs, and not the Government-Aided or IP JCs?
MOE’s priorities in planning schools are to provide quality education, meet demand for school places at both national and local levels, and ensure accessibility based on proximity to housing developments and public transport.
Schools are identified for mergers based on factors such as: (i) sufficient enrolment to ensure critical mass for a wide range of educational programmes and co-curricular activities; (ii) the geographical proximity of affected schools; and (iii) the infrastructure capacity to support the merged school.
MOE had studied the different potential merger partners carefully. In considering the compatibility of merger partners, we generally prefer to pair Government schools. The mergers would be far more complex and challenging if we paired a Government school with a Government-Aided school, as their legal and governance structures are different and difficult to integrate.
In addition, JC merger partners were selected based on geography, so as to maintain a good spread of JCs across the country. We started by looking at the overall demand and supply of JC places. After assessing that we should merge four pairs of JCs, it came down to finding suitable merger pairs.
Integrated Programme (IP) JCs and non-IP JCs are not compatible merger partners because they offer different programmes to suit their students’ needs. On the other hand, we found that we could retain a reasonably good geographical distribution by merging the existing eight Government JCs.


6. Will “weaker” students be able to secure a place in JCs? Won’t the remaining JCs have higher cut-off points?
Every JC-eligible student – with a L1R5 score of 20 or better – is assured of a JC place.
Following the mergers, there will be some reduction in the overall number of JC places but this would have taken into consideration the reduction in cohort sizes. This is to ensure all JC eligible students who wish to have a JC education will be posted to a JC. As in previous years, the posting will be by merit, and this may or may not be the student’s preferred choice.
For 2018, as part of the transition for the 2019 JC mergers, we expect to open up more places in all the JCs (less the four JCs not admitting JC1 students in 2018) to ensure sufficient JC places to meet the demand from all eligible students. This could lead to some fluctuations in the cut-off points for JCs in the 2018 JAE.
Cut-off points are neither pre-determined by MOE nor the JCs, but are dependent on students’ choice patterns across the JCs from year to year.

7. Why did MOE build Eunoia JC when cohort sizes are dropping?
MOE regularly reviews our education landscape and curriculum in line with the needs of our society in the future.
Eunoia JC leverages the strengths of each partner secondary school (Catholic High, CHIJ St Nicholas Girls’ and Singapore Chinese Girls’), so as to offer innovative programming.
Even though we had anticipated falling cohort sizes in the coming years, we decided in 2010 that we should not hold back this new JC model, so that more students can benefit from the Integrated Programme.   
This is no different from what we did for secondary schools. Even though we were aware of falling cohort sizes in the coming years, we decided to invest in two new Specialised Schools – Crest (2013) and Spectra (2014) – to benefit those who would be more suited for the applied learning track with a special Normal (Technical) curriculum.   


8. What will happen to teachers in the merging schools? Can the remaining JCs take in all the JC teachers who are not posted to the merged school? 
There will be no retrenchment of MOE staff. Staff will either be posted to the merged school, or redeployed to other schools or to HQ. Some of the teachers may have to be redeployed to teach at other school levels, e.g. from JC to Secondary, or from Secondary to Primary levels. MOE will provide the necessary training and support for these teachers.
Teachers who are affected by the school mergers can apply for available positions at other JCs during MOE’s internal posting exercise. However, we expect the number of JC vacancies to be fewer than the number of JC teachers to be redeployed. Some of these teachers will therefore have to consider a move to secondary or primary schools, where they can continue to contribute.
The Ministry will provide these teachers with the necessary support. The Academy of Teachers (AST) will run bridging courses for those who are deployed to secondary or primary schools, to equip them with the necessary pedagogical skills and content knowledge to teach at the secondary or primary level.

Savings & Taxes,Why is GST applied to the water conservation tax?,/factually/content/why-is-gst-applied-to-the-water-conservation-tax,"
                Why is GST applied to the water conservation tax?
            ","
                    06 Feb 2018
                ","The water conservation tax (WCT) and the GST serve different purposes. 
The WCT is levied on all water consumers, to reflect the fact that water is precious, and to encourage every individual and company to play a role in conserving our water resources. When the WCT is added to the water tariff, consumers are paying the long-run marginal cost of water: what it cost to produce the next drop of water from our desalination and Newater plants. 
The GST is a tax levied on the consumption of goods and services. It is calculated based on the final price of goods or services, inclusive of any other taxes and duties. The WCT is part of the final price of water that the GST is levied on. This is similar to practices in other countries such as the United Kingdom and New Zealand. 
What is important is that the Government keeps our system of taxes fair, by helping the lower- and middle-income households through subsidies and grants. 
For example, the permanent GST Voucher scheme has a U-Save component which provides rebates to more than 880,000 HDB households each year to offset their utility bills, with more rebates for those living in smaller HDB flats.

Housing,Why did HDB restrict Sigma from tendering for new projects in 2015?,/factually/content/why-did-hdb-restrict-sigma-from-tendering-for-new-projects-in-2015,"
                Why did HDB restrict Sigma from tendering for new projects in 2015?
            ","
                    06 Feb 2018
                ","Sigma has been installing lifts in HDB estates for the past 10 years. Of the approximately 24,000 lifts in HDB estates, about 3,500 are Sigma lifts. The overall performance of Sigma lifts has generally been comparable with that of other lift brands.

So why did HDB restrict Sigma from tendering for new projects in 2015?

Failing to fulfil contractual obligations

In 2013, HDB awarded Sigma a tender to install 469 lifts. However, Sigma was unable to adhere to its contractual deadlines. Hence, in October 2015, HDB restricted Sigma from tendering for new HDB lift contracts so that the company could focus its resources towards fulfilling its existing contractual obligations.

Tender restrictions are a part of HDB’s quality management system to ensure that its contractors are able to deliver to HDB’s standards and contractual requirements. This applies to all HDB contractors, not just lift contractors.

Higher-than-usual breakdown and fault rates

In 2016, HDB observed a higher-than-usual breakdown and fault rate in lifts from this batch of 469 Sigma lifts, particularly in their first year of operations. 

The issues with this batch of 469 Sigma lifts are different from typical lift faults or incidents, which usually involve older lifts, from a variety of lift brands, and which are largely maintenance related.  

For the 469 Sigma lifts, investigations by HDB and independent Authorised Examiners revealed that the design and installation of these lifts complied with prevailing codes and standards.

However, the doors and sensors were more susceptible to misalignment from knocks from heavy and rough lift usage, which typically takes place during the first year of operations from renovation and moving activities.  

HDB has since instructed Sigma to rectify these issues and to carry out improvement works to ensure that the lift doors and sensors operate smoothly. HDB has also issued stern warnings to Sigma, and is closely monitoring the performance of its lifts. 

Both Sigma and its parent company have channelled more resources towards addressing the issues.  In particular, Sigma has undertaken the rectification works progressively, and this has resulted in some observed improvements in lift performance.

HDB will continue to hold Sigma accountable for ensuring its lifts meet the required performance standards. Until this is achieved, the tender restriction on Sigma will continue.

                ","What is the difference between Singapore's VEP and Malaysia's RC?
Malaysia’s Road Charge is a 24/7 levy imposed on all non-Malaysian-registered cars entering Malaysia on road via Johor. 100% of Singapore-registered cars entering Malaysia on road via Johor will pay the Malaysia Road Charge.
On the contrary, only about one out of ten foreign-registered vehicles that enter Singapore pay Singapore’s VEP, and these are mostly driven by those who work in Singapore. The other 90% do not pay the VEP as they enter Singapore during VEP-free days or hours.
Singapore’s VEP policy, which has been in place since 1973, is meant to equalise the cost of owning and using foreign-registered vehicles in Singapore with that of owning and using Singapore-registered vehicles.  It ensures comprehensiveness of our vehicle population control policy - that there is similar restrain to using foreign vehicles on Singapore’s roads as there is for Singapore vehicles, which are subject to the Certificate of Entitlement (COE) system and high vehicle taxes.
Hence, the intent of the VEP policy is different from that of Malaysia’s Road Charge.
As long as Singapore is the only country affected by Malaysia’s Road Charge, we have no choice but to respond with the Reciprocal Road Charge (RRC). However, once the Road Charge is implemented at all of Malaysia’s other land borders, at an equal quantum and on all non-Malaysian-registered cars, we will remove our RRC.
Do Singapore-registered cars have to pay the VEP?
No, the VEP is levied only on foreign-registered cars. Singapore-registered cars are also not subjected to the Reciprocal Road Charge.

                    06 Feb 2018
                ","1. What does the New Rail Financing Framework mean for you?
With LTA as the owner of all operating assets, it will be able to build up, replace and upgrade the assets in a timely manner. Rail operators can then focus on providing reliable and well-maintained rail services for commuters. Fares will also not be affected as they are regulated by the Public Transport Council. Commuter interests remain at the heart of the transition to the New Rail Financing Framework (NRFF).

2. What operating assets will be transferred to LTA?
The operating assets include the trains, signalling system and maintenance equipment such as rail grinding vehicles, electrical and fire protection equipment as well as equipment for power and building services. There are over 60,000 operating asset items.

3. Is the asset transfer a fair transaction?
Yes, LTA will pay SMRT Trains the Net Book Value (NBV), or the cost after depreciation, of the operating assets as stated in SMRT Trains’ and SMRT Light Rail’s accounts as at 30 September 2016. This fair and objective approach was also used when the transfer of assets from the Government to SMRT Trains happened in 1998.
LTA will conduct an audit of SMRT Trains’ and SMRT Light Rail’s finances to verify the NBV of the operating assets being transferred. At the same time, LTA will also assess the condition of the older operating assets to make sure they are in acceptable condition. LTA is entitled to withhold payments for assets that need to be fixed or replaced.
4. Will this transition affect SMRT Trains’ and SMRT Light Rail’s staff?
No. The transition only involves the transfer of ownership of operating assets and will not have an impact on SMRT Trains’ and SMRT Light Rail’s staff.
5. Is Singapore moving towards a nationalised rail sector?
No. The Government is not nationalising the rail sector. A nationalised system is one where the Government itself operates the rail services. Under the NRFF, private rail operators licensed by LTA will continue to run the rail services.
6. How are the discussions with SBS Transit on the transition of the North East Line to the NRFF going?
Discussions are still on-going. Transition will only proceed after both the Government and SBS Transit have agreed on terms.

                ","Most of the cases surfaced after MOH took quick action to conduct broader checks.
On 27 August, the Ministry of Health and National Environment Agency confirmed the first locally-transmitted case of the Zika virus, as well as the presence of three other suspect cases involving people who live or work in the Aljunied Crescent/Sims Drive area. The number of confirmed cases increased to 41 just a day later on 28 August.


How did one confirmed case increase to 41 cases in just a day? There are several factors for this:
1. The additional cases were identified after MOH conducted active testing of past patients who could potentially have been infected persons. Most of these patients have since recovered.
Timeline of the Zika infection

2. People who have been infected by Zika will show no or mild symptoms only. As the majority of people infected with the virus do not show symptoms, it is likely that some transmission may already have taken place before these cases of Zika were confirmed.
3. Mosquitoes in the area may have already infected new and unreported cases of other people who may not yet show any symptoms.
Due to the factors above, it is expected that more positive cases will be identified in the coming days as the screening of close contacts continue.
Thus, you should not be alarmed if there is a sudden increase in the number of positive cases.
You can play a part in reducing the risk of further spread of Zika. Do the  to prevent mosquito breeding in your home. If you have travelled to an affected country, or live in an area with a known Zika case, monitor your health and consult a doctor if you are unwell, especially if you have a fever and rash.

                ","The Ministry of Health (MOH) and National Environment Agency (NEA) have confirmed several cases of locally transmitted Zika virus infection, some of whom have recovered. They are not known to have travelled to Zika-affected areas recently and are thus likely to have been infected in Singapore.
Find out the latest updates on the Zika situation in Singapore right here.
1. What is the Singapore Government doing about the locally transmitted cases?
Screening and remaining alert
MOH will continue to screen the close contacts of confirmed cases. All suspect cases will be isolated pending confirmation of the blood test results.
All GPs, polyclinics and hospitals have been alerted and are to immediately report patients with symptoms associated with Zika virus infection to MOH. MOH and NEA will also alert residents in the vicinity to seek medical attention should they develop symptoms.
Isolation
For now, as an added precaution, all suspect cases of Zika virus infection will be isolated while awaiting confirmation of the blood test results.
Prevention
NEA has intensified vector control operations to control the Aedes mosquito population. Vector control operations include:
NEA will also be activating partner agencies of the Inter-Agency Dengue Task Force to step up localised search and destroy efforts in their respective areas.
2. What is the Zika virus? 
Zika virus infection is transmitted by the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito. The Aedes mosquito is also a known carrier of the Dengue and Chikungunya viruses. 
Zika is generally a mild disease.  It may cause a viral fever similar to dengue or chikungunya, with fever, skin rashes, body aches, and headache.  Some infected with the Zika virus may not even develop symptoms.
However, Zika virus infection may cause microcephaly in the unborn foetuses of pregnant women. Microcephaly is a rare neurological condition that manifests itself as birth defects in which a baby is born with significantly smaller heads.
3. How do I know if I have Zika?

The symptoms for Zika include:
Most people infected with the Zika virus do not develop symptoms. For those who do, the symptoms are often very mild. They usually develop within 3 to 12 days after the mosquito bite and often last between 4 to 7 days. 
If you have travelled to an affected country, or live in an area with a known Zika case, you should monitor your health and consult a doctor if you are unwell, especially if you have a fever and rash. 
We advise residents, especially pregnant women, in the Aljunied Crescent area to monitor their health. Seek medical attention if you are unwell, especially with symptoms such as fever and rash. Those without these symptoms but who are concerned that they have been infected with the Zika virus should consult and follow the advice of their doctors regarding the monitoring of their pregnancy.

                Why is a centralised NAC bin centre needed?
            ","
                    06 Feb 2018
                ","With reference to the report of the Auditor-General for the Financial Year 2015/16, we accept and acknowledge that the cost assessment for the consultancy services in relation to the centralised bin centre should have been more robust. Relevant processes will be put in place to ensure that the norm for cost assessment of consultancy fees will be adopted for future development projects.
Why a centralised bin centre?
There could be some misunderstanding about the reasons for building the bin centre. It was not a standalone project; but part of redevelopment for the Civic District which is an important cultural and heritage area for Singapore. 
In the past, Victoria Theatre and Victoria Concert Hall (VTVCH), Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM) and Parliament House had their own bin centres.
However, with the redevelopment of the District, there was an opportunity to build a centralised refuse collection centre to serve ACM, VTVCH and Parliament House. This would allow for improved operational processes and enhance the aesthetics of the area.
A suitable location was eventually identified at ACM’s existing outhouse, above its basement, and the construction cost was less than 1% of the development cost for VTVCH.
Why was the project complex and complicated?
This was not a simple bin centre to build. There were many considerations and technical challenges, including the following:
a) structural and reinforcement works as it was above the ACM basement;
b) mechanical and electrical services;
c) diversion of existing underground services; 
d) consideration of ventilation to prevent foul smell from escaping from the bin centre;
e) sensitivity to ACM offices which are right next to  the bin centre; 
f) façade design as the aesthetics of the historic area needed to be preserved;
g) study of traffic flow, e.g., the impact on the ACM unloading/loading bay.
Why were consultancy services necessary?
Consultancy services were necessary because of the complexity of the project. The consultancy services included a feasibility study taking into account the various requirements of three separate institutions — ACM, VTVCH and Parliament House. The needs of each stakeholder had to be met while providing a holistic solution for the whole precinct. 
The consultancy services also included technical study, design proposal, design documentation, tender and contract administration, compliance with all regulatory requirements, etc. 
What has changed for the Civic District?
The Civic District is the historical birthplace of modern Singapore. With the redevelopment, Singaporeans now enjoy the new improvements to the District. There are more green spaces, pedestrian walkways, waterfront steps and even phone-charging benches.
Traffic flow has also improved, and pedestrians can now walk easily between ACM, VTVCH, National Gallery Singapore, Empress Place and Esplanade Park. You can also take a walk along the waterfront plazas in front of the ACM, and at Queen Elizabeth Walk, there are steps that lead to the water's edge.

How are Town Gas Tariffs calculated?
Town gas tariffs are meant to reflect changes in the cost of producing and transporting town gas. They are reviewed and approved every quarter by the Energy Market Authority (EMA) to ensure that town gas consumers are not overcharged.
Marginal increase next quarter
There will be a marginal increase in town gas tariffs for the quarter from 1 August to 31 October 2016. The increase for this quarter is due to the higher cost of fuel (specifically natural gas and naphtha) used to produce town gas. The fuel cost has risen by 26.2 percent compared with the previous quarter. Despite this increase, the tariff is still lower than the preceding quarters from August 2015 to April 2016. The town gas tariff for August to October will remain lower than in earlier quarters, from August 2015 to April 2016 (see graph above).
How is Government helping?
The Government provides Singaporean households with a GST Voucher – Utilities Save (U-Save) rebate, to help lower living expenses. Singaporean households can look forward to the following vouchers, to offset the increase in town gas tariffs.

                    06 Feb 2018
                ","The Government is raising the salary qualifying criteria for Employment Pass (EP) applications from $3,300 to $3,600. The change will take effect from 1 January 2017. It is part of the Ministry of Manpower’s regular updating of the criteria to keep pace with rising local wages and to maintain the quality of our foreign workforce.
Q: Does this mean EP holders will be employed at higher salaries compared to the local workers?
The EP salary qualifying criteria is a quality bar that foreigners have to pass to be eligible for EP.  
With a higher EP salary bar, fewer foreigners are able to qualify for it. Raising the bar is actually a way to moderate the number of EP holders in Singapore.  
Increasing the salary criteria does not mean that all EP holders will receive a higher salary. Those who do not qualify will have to leave, or be emplaced on S pass, for which a quota and levy apply.
A higher salary bar will also reduce the risk of employers preferring to hire EP holders over Singaporeans due to the foreigners being cheaper.
Q: Is this a minimum wage for (EP) holders? 
No, there is no minimum wage set for both locals and foreigners working in Singapore. EP holders will receive salaries that will match their qualifications, experience and expertise.
However, foreigners will have to earn at least S$3,600 per month to qualify for the EP. Those with lower salaries will have to apply for an S Pass to work in Singapore.
Q: I heard many companies falsely declare a higher salary for their EP holders. Is the EP salary criteria effective in moderating the inflow of EP holders? 
MOM takes a serious view of fraudulent submissions of salary information and errant employers will be prosecuted for false salary declarations. The following are examples of employers who have been taken to task for salary declarations:
MOM will continue to conduct stringent checks to detect and act against false declarations of EP salaries. 
If you know of any person or employer who has made false salary declarations, please report the matter to MOM at 6438 5122 or email mom_fmmd@mom.gov.sg.

                Why are MRT trains being shipped back to manufacturer?
            ","
                    06 Feb 2018
                ","Why are MRT trains being shipped back to their manufacturer? 
Defects were found during a check of new trains manufactured by Kawasaki Heavy Industries and CSR Sifang in late 2013. There were a few hairline cracks on the car-body. These are superficial cracks (like those that show up on the walls of a new house). They are not structural cracks and are not safety-critical. No cracks were found on other train components after further inspections.

Are these defects dangerous? 
The defects are hairline cracks (due to material impurity that occurred during manufacturing) and are not safety-critical. They do not affect the train’s systems, performance or passengers’ safety.

Are the trains still under warranty? 
Yes, they are still under the manufacturer’s warranty. As such, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) is sending the trains in small batches back to the manufacturer for rectification. This is the appropriate thing to do to ensure we get the value for our money.  

How can you be sure the trains are safe?
To ensure that trains are safe for passenger service, all defects are monitored closely. Monthly safety assessments are also conducted by LTA and the manufacturer before trains are put into service.

LTA also commissioned an external third party assessment in 2013 which had confirmed that the trains are safe to operate. As advised by the third party assessment, there has also been close monitoring of the crack propagation rate.

Why send back only one train at a time and not all 26 trains?
To ensure adequate train availability, only one train (six train cars) is sent back for repair at any one time. Starting next year, two trains will be sent back concurrently as we will have more new and upgraded trains to maintain train availability.

Why do the trains have to be sent back to China for repair?
The most effective way to address the defects is to replace the entire car-body shell. However, due to the lack of facilities and space for such replacement works of such nature at our Singapore train depots, the trains were sent back for repairs.

Why transport these trains in the dead of night?
Our trains are big and massive equipment. They are transported at night, with auxiliary police officers clearing the way ahead, to minimise obstruction and inconvenience to road users. Likewise, new trains that arrive in Singapore are transported on our roads at night.

Then why cover them up in green covers?
The green covers are to protect the trains, just as how we would bubble-wrap or enclose in boxes and styrofoam-pad electronic equipment and machinery that we want to transport overseas.  

Will the repairs really take 7 years?  
No, LTA has negotiated with the manufacturer and it will be able to speed up the process. Trains are being sent in batches and the rectification work will be completed in 2019. Each train car body replacement takes up to four months.

Was there really a case of a battery explosion? 
The battery housing cover for one train undergoing testing before being put into service, flew open due to a build-up of gases. Immediate action was taken to improve the battery housing design for all affected trains. 

What about shattered train windows?
No defects were found on train windows (the large ones behind passenger seats). However, cracks on draughtscreens (the glass panel at the side of a row of seats) were found on five trains. These were due to errors during the installation process which caused stress pressures on the glass, and unrelated to the incidents of hairline cracks on the trains.

                ","Our general approach has been to ensure that car owners pay a fair share of the cost of carparks by recovering the cost through carpark charges. 

While carpark charges have not changed since 2002, inflation as well as costs of operating public car parks have increased significantly. Since 2002, core-inflation has risen by about 30%. Total costs of operating public carparks have increased even more over the same period, by a total of about 40%. 

For HDB carparks, which account for 90% of carparks in Singapore, costs have increased due to several factors:


Without the fee revision, HDB projects that it will face an average deficit of more than $100m annually in the coming years.

For URA’s many carparks in the city centre, parking charges are set higher than HDB carparks in order to appropriately manage parking demand. Despite this, without the fee revision, URA expects to incur a deficit in its carpark activity.

                ","TR Emeritus has once again sought to mislead the public by publishing a vicious claim that a Cabinet Minister is “fully entitled to free A-Class healthcare in government and restructured hospitals”, giving the impression Minister Heng Swee Keat’s medical expenses are being funded by taxpayers. This is a blatant lie.

As TRE would have known very well if it had bothered to check the facts, Ministers in Singapore are on the same medical benefit scheme – the Medisave-cum-Subsidised Outpatient (MSO) scheme – as most civil servants. Officers on the MSO Scheme get a 2% CPF contribution to their Medisave accounts capped at $2,380 per year on top of their normal statutory Medisave contributions. This can then be used to buy Medishield Life or other portable Medisave-approved insurance plan to cover their inpatient needs. Ministers receive no extra benefits for themselves or their spouses/children. All Ministers and other political office-holders pay tax.

Minister Heng’s hospitalisation is most certainly not borne by taxpayers’ monies.

The Editor of TRE added a caveat at the end of the said article that he wishes Minister Heng well, but decided to reproduce the “letter” anyway to “show an alternative angle to his situation and the underlying socio-political issues”. A vicious lie is not an ""alternative angle”. Choosing to run an article that contained glaring misinformation that could have been easily searched and verified online is irresponsible.

                    07 Feb 2018
                ","There have been a few online articles recently relating to the management of CPF monies. One article alleged that our CPF has been “seriously mismanaged” by the CPF CEO. The article led some netizens to allege that the Government is “robbing” CPF members of their hard-earned money. There was also an online article which alleged that the CPF Board kept the difference between interest earned on new Special Singapore Government Securities (SSGS) issued at 4% interest per annum, and the interest paid on savings in the Ordinary Account (OA) of 3.5% on the first $20,000 and 2.5% on the rest of the OA savings, while another asked how the government was going to repay CPF monies if their investments were to fail. These articles are misleading.
To put the record straight, the CPF Board invests CPF members’ savings in SSGS, and the coupon rates which these SSGS earn for CPFB match the interest rates that CPF members receive. For example, for Ordinary Account savings earning a 2.5% interest rate, the corresponding SSGS will have a matching 2.5% coupon rate. On the other hand, for Special, Retirement and Medisave Account monies that are invested in SSGS paying a coupon of 4% per annum, CPF members will receive 4% on these balances. CPF members do not bear any investment risk at all in their CPF balances. The investment risk is borne by the Government. Their monies are safe, and the returns that they have been promised are fully guaranteed by the Government. This is a solid guarantee as the Singapore Government is one of the few remaining triple-A credit-rated governments in the world.   
The Government has already provided detailed explanations on how CPF monies are managed. The details on the management of CPF monies and how CPF interest rates are determined can be found on MOF’s website.
For CPF members who wish to take more risks in hope of higher returns, they can do so by investing their monies directly in the market through the CPF Investment Scheme (CPFIS).

                    07 Feb 2018
                ","Yes, your vote is secret. 

When an election is held in Singapore, the Elections Department follows the procedures laid out by law to ensure the integrity of the election. There is a process to ensure the security of your vote and voting secrecy, and it is rigorous. There is no break in the chain of custody of ballot papers from the polling station to the counting centre, and from the counting centre to the Supreme Court where the ballot papers are retained in safe custody for 6 months and then subsequently destroyed. For transparency, the process is open to observation by candidates and their agents who are present.

What is the vote counting process like?

Before polling commences at 8 am

Ballot boxes are marked and shown to candidates and their polling agents who are present, so they can verify that the boxes are empty. The boxes are then sealed by election officials at the polling station. This is done before the start of the polls on Polling Day.

After polls close at 8 pm

After the polls have closed, election officials at the polling station seal the ballot boxes containing the ballot papers which have been cast. Candidates and their polling agents who are present witness the process and may also place their own seals on the ballot boxes. The sealed ballot boxes are then transported under Police escort to the counting centre.  

Counting of votes 

At the counting centre, candidates and their counting agents may inspect all the boxes again to ascertain that all the boxes are accounted for, and that no others are present; and to ensure that the seals of all the ballot boxes are intact and have not been tampered with. Once they are satisfied that the boxes have remained secure, the seals are broken and the ballot boxes opened. The ballot papers will be poured out, sorted and counted. 
Is it possible to know the vote outcome of a certain part of a constituency? Would this compromise voting secrecy?

Votes cast at each polling station are counted separately. The Assistant Returning Officer is required to announce the counting result for each polling station to candidates and counting agents who are present. The results for all polling stations in a constituency are then tallied to obtain the election result for that constituency.

While it is possible for candidates and counting agents to know how voters have voted for various polling stations in aggregate, it is not possible to know who an individual voter has voted for. Voting secrecy is thus preserved.

What is a sample count?



https://www.youtube.com/embed/vXnjf5MyghA"" https://www.youtube.com/embed/vXnjf5MyghA"" 


 

A sample count is performed at the start of the counting process. It gives an early indication of the possible electoral outcome for an electoral division. This helps prevent speculation and misinformation from unofficial sources while counting is underway, and before official results are announced.

At each polling station, counting assistants pick up a random bundle of 100 ballot papers in front of the candidates and counting agents present. The votes for each candidate are then counted from this random bundle. The votes will be added up, with weightage given to account for the difference in number of votes cast at each polling station. It will then be shown as a percentage of valid votes garnered by each candidate.

Why is there a serial number on my ballot paper?

To counter ballot box stuffing

The serial numbers on ballot papers enable strict accounting of all ballot papers issued and cast. That way, the number of papers found in the ballot box at the end of the election can be tallied with the number issued during the poll and the number of ballot papers stocked before the polls opened.

To prevent impersonation

If a voter casts a vote pretending to be someone else, numbered ballot papers will allow the court to match the suspicious ballot paper with the counterfoil, on which the voter's registration number is recorded.

What happens to the ballot papers after the votes have been counted?



https://www.youtube.com/embed/cbXG2z3oG5A"" https://www.youtube.com/embed/cbXG2z3oG5A"" 



 
After the election results have been announced, all ballot papers and their counterfoils are transported from the counting centre to the Supreme Court. They are then sealed in the Supreme Court vault for 6 months, before they are destroyed. The process is open to observation by candidates and their agents who are present.

Theoretically, it is possible for anyone with access to the ballot papers to identify who cast a particular vote.

However, ballot papers can only be retrieved by court order, if the court is satisfied that a vote has been fraudulently cast and the result of the election may be affected as a result.

                ","An online article recently implied that Government stopped giving an elderly woman Public Assistance because she was dying from terminal cancer. It suggested that Government wanted to “stop wasting money on those who are dying”. What’s the truth?

Public Assistance

The ComCare Long Term Assistance Scheme, also commonly known as Public Assistance Scheme, is designed to help those who are permanently unable to work due to old age, illness or disability, and have little or no means of income and family support. The Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) reviews recipients’ cases periodically to ensure that those who need additional assistance will get the help they need. 

The case highlighted in the online article involved an elderly woman who had received Public Assistance since 1990, after she became unemployed. A recent review found that she had substantial CPF monies which she could tap on for monthly payouts, as well as a paid-up flat. She also had a reasonable sum in her Medisave Account. As such, her financial assistance under the Public Assistance scheme could not be extended as she did not meet the criteria.

MSF explained to her that she could get monthly payouts from her Retirement Account. In the meantime, MSF continued to give her other forms of financial assistance and also a Medical Fee Assistance Card for her medical expenses at public healthcare institutions. This would be on top of existing medical subsidies. 

MSF will review her case again in July 2016.

Assistance with medical bills

No one will be denied the medical care they need. The Ministry of Health has safety nets in place to help Singaporeans who do not have family support, and do not have sufficient money in their Medisave account to pay their medical bills. One of the help schemes available is Medifund.

This is not true.

Melamine food wares have a history of safe use. There have been no scientific reports on adverse health effects associated with the use of melamine food wares. When properly used, the level of migration of melamine from food wares is insignificant or very low, and do not pose a health risk to the public.

The Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority (AVA) advises the following on the use of melamine food ware:

The Singapore Food Regulations stipulate the safety requirements for food-contact plastics (e.g. food ware like bowls, plates and utensils) that are imported and sold in Singapore. Manufacturers of food-contact plastics are required to conduct tests on their products to ensure that they comply with the relevant legislation and restrictions for the intended condition of use.
Further, under the Environmental Public Health (Food Hygiene) Regulations, food operators and their food handlers are required to ensure that their crockery, utensils or appliances are not chipped, broken, cracked or damaged at all times.

The AVA conducts regular post-market surveillance involving the sampling and testing of food ware (including melamine food wares), to ensure that they do not release any harmful substances when exposed to food or under intended use conditions. Food wares that fail the tests would not be allowed for sale.

The Cross Island Line (CRL) will be an important part of our MRT network. It will provide a faster commute between the east and the west, from Changi to Jurong, stretching more than 50 km with about 30 stations. Nearly half of these stations will be interchange stations. Our preliminary estimate is that commuters from residential areas like Loyang, Pasir Ris, Hougang, Ang Mo Kio, Sin Ming, Bukit Timah, Clementi and West Coast will make at least 600,000 trips on the CRL every day. This will place the CRL higher, in terms of capacity and usage, compared to the North East Line. The CRL will also significantly enhance the resilience of our network, as the CRL will connect with all radial lines to provide commuters with many more travel routes to their destinations.

Why can’t the government just go with the alignment that does not cut through the CCNR?

In addition, there will not be any construction work on the surface level within the gazetted boundary of CCNR. For both options, construction will be undertaken by tunnelling method using a Tunnel Boring Machine that starts from outside the nature reserve (see diagram below).

                ","Singapore is not affected by haze throughout the year, unlike other places that experience high levels of air pollution year round.  There is no data to show that patterns of exposure experienced by Singaporeans would cause longer-term health problems like cancer.
While the patterns of haze exposure experienced by Singaporeans can result in short-term worsening of disease for those who already have chronic heart or lung disease, more information is still needed on its impact over the years.

For healthy people, short term exposure to high levels of haze particles may irritate their eyes, nose, and throat – these are temporary and would generally be resolved on its own.

For more information on the haze and its health impact, check out MOH’s FAQ.

                ","The 3-hour Pollutant Standards Index (PSI) is based on PM2.5 concentration levels averaged over three hours. PM2.5 refers to fine particles in the air.
The 3-hour PSI is NOT an indication of how clear the sky is, and doesn't always correspond with how hazy it looks. Other factors such as weather and humidity also affect visibility.
The closest indication of air quality is the 1-hour PM2.5 concentration levels. This reading can change quickly when there is haze.

                ","In the tropics, cloud seeding is normally targeted at convective or cumulus clouds which have a typical life span of just one to two hours. As winds are generally light in our equatorial region, the possibility of seeded clouds in neighbouring countries being blown to Singapore within such a short time is remote.
A common cloud seeding agent used by neighbouring countries is sodium chloride (common salt). The low salt content in cloud-seeded rain does not cause significant impact on the environment and human health. Rain water analysis conducted by the National Environment Agency (NEA) has not shown any unusual change in the rain composition.

                ","The National Environment Agency (NEA) is aware that there is an SMS rumour being circulated suggesting that the Government is conducting cloud-seeding to mitigate the impact of haze on F1, and that the resultant rain from this is harmful. These claims are untrue.
 
 
The Government has not been conducting cloud-seeding and has no plans to do so. Cloud seeding attempts to artificially induce rain by implanting clouds with suitable particles. However, there are no reliable means to validate the effectiveness of cloud seeding in Singapore. Cloud seeding also requires existing clouds as it cannot generate rain out of thin and dry air. During dry seasons, cloud seeding is less effective due to the lack of suitable clouds for seeding. The small size of Singapore and the variability of winds also mean that the induced rain, if any, may not fall directly over our island.

                ","There is a rumour circulating online that as long as a foreigner fulfils the Council of Estate Agencies (CEA)’s criteria, they will be allowed to register as real estate or property agents, and are hence jeopardising Singaporeans’ rice bowls. 
 
This does not provide the full picture.
 
The total number of foreigners on Employment Pass who are registered salespersons is very small. They constitute about 0.1% of the total pool of about 30,000 salespersons or less than 40 currently. They are salaried staff and mostly employed by real estate consultancies who serve international clients. 
 
As a default, CEA only allows Singaporeans and PRs to be salespersons. They must meet the CEA's registration criteria listed on its website (www.cea.gov.sg), which includes undergoing the real estate salesperson examination to ensure that they are familiar with our local laws. 

But, CEA does make some exceptions. Estate agents who intend to employ foreigners to be salespersons must seek CEA’s preliminary assessment. CEA only considers Employment Pass holders who are able to value add to the estate agency industry and contribute to the industry’s development.  CEA requires the applicant to possess specialised expertise and experience in international estate agency work, such as understanding their international clients’ business requirements and sourcing for buildings/complexes which meet their business needs. 
 
If anyone suspects someone of carrying out unlicensed estate agency work, they should report the case to CEA for investigation.

                    01 Jul 2018
                ","[Updated as of 01 July 2018]
There are rumours circulating online that the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) allows Indian nationals to work in Singapore without a valid work pass and that firms can hire Indian intra-corporate transferees (“ICTs”) without adhering to fair employment guidelines.
This is not true. 
Foreign nationals, including ICTs, have to meet the work pass qualifying criteria before they are allowed to work in Singapore. The Fair Consideration Framework (FCF) also applies to all firms in Singapore, whether they employ locals or foreigners. The FCF details requirements, including advertising in the national Jobs Bank and scrutiny for companies with suspect hiring practices.
What is CECA?
CECA is a comprehensive agreement with India to encourage bilateral cooperation and economic integration between our countries. In addition to expanded tariff concessions and improved rules of origin which give Singapore businesses greater access to India’s market, CECA allows for the movement of four types of business people between Singapore and India. Existing regulations on citizenship, residence and employment will still apply. The agreement entered into force on 1 August 2005. The latest review was concluded on 1 June 2018 with no change to the chapter on movement of people. 
What is the FCF?
The FCF sets out the Government’s expectations for all firms in Singapore to have fair employment practices. All firms should adhere to the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices  and have fair employment practices that are open, merit-based and non-discriminatory.
Under the FCF, firms are also required to advertise job vacancies on the national Jobs Bank before submitting Employment Pass applications. This is to ensure that employers reach out to a larger pool of candidates as part of a fair hiring process.
For practical reasons, certain groups are exempted from the job advertising requirement but are still expected to be brought in via a fair process. These exemptions include:
Employers recruiting for such positions typically use executive search firms, rather than open advertisements. Firms are expected to instruct their headhunters to source for candidates on merit, including Singaporean candidates.
Firms suspected to have engaged in discriminatory hiring practices will have their Employment Pass applications subjected to additional scrutiny by the Ministry of Manpower and could have their work pass privileges curtailed.

                ","Countering ballot box stuffing
 
The serial numbers on ballot papers enable strict accounting of all ballot papers issued and cast. That way, the number of papers found in the ballot box at the end of the election can be tallied with the number issued during the poll and the number of ballot papers stocked before the polls opened.  
 
Preventing impersonation
 
If a voter casts a vote pretending to be someone else, numbered ballot papers will allow the court to match the suspicious ballot paper with the counterfoil, on which the voter's registration number is recorded. If any suspicious activity is proven, the vote will not count. 
 
How is my vote still secret then?
 
Theoretically, it is possible for anyone with access to the ballot papers to identify who cast a particular vote. Matching the numbers between the ballot paper, counterfoil, and electoral register can reveal a voter’s identity
 
However, ballot papers can be examined only under strict conditions, and there are safeguards that make it extremely difficult to find out how any particular voter voted.
 
All ballot papers and their counterfoils have to be sealed in the Supreme Court vault for 6 months, after which they will be destroyed.
 
During those 6 months, these documents can only be retrieved by court order. The court will issue such an order only if it is satisfied that a vote has been fraudulently cast and the result of the election may be affected as a result.

                Has a video by the SDP been unfairly classified as a Party Political Film?
            ","
                    19 Feb 2018
                ","In consultation with the Political Films Consultative Committee[1], the Media Development Authority (MDA) found that the SDP-produced video entitled “Pappy Washing Powder” is a Party Political Film (PPF). 
 
Dr Chee Soon Juan and some online articles allege that this classification is unfair.
 
The Films Act disallows the making, distribution and exhibition of PPFs.  PPFs include films which employ dramatization and/or animation to distort, sensationalise and mislead viewers on political matters.  The prohibition on PPFs ensures that political discussion in Singapore is conducted in a responsible and dignified manner that befits the seriousness of the election process, and not by sensationalising serious issues in a biased or emotional manner.
 
 
The law exempts certain types of films from being classified as PPFs, such as:  
 
(a) Live recordings of events held in accordance with the law; 
 
(b) Anniversary and commemorative videos of political parties; 
 
(c) Factual documentaries, biographies or autobiographies; 
 
(d) Manifestos of political parties produced by or on behalf of a political party; 
 
(e) Candidate's declaration of policies or ideology produced by or on behalf of the candidate; and 
 
(f) Films made solely for the purpose of reporting of news by a licensed broadcasting service. 
 
 
In a Facebook post, Dr Chee claimed that the Government’s educational videos on MediShield Life (here and here) should also be considered PPFs, because they “depict the serious issue of MediShield Life in a comical fashion”. 
 
However, unlike the “Pappy Washing Powder” video, the two MediShield Life videos do not promote or discredit any political party through dramatisation. Instead they are videos produced by the Government to educate the public, especially our Pioneer Generation, on how they could benefit from the MediShield Life scheme. The MediShield Life videos are hence not PPFs.
 
One online article invited readers to tell why the “Pappy Washing Powder” video was classified as a PPF, and not an earlier People’s Action Party video “Re-Ignite the Passion of Servant Leadership”.  Another online article asked “whether party sponsored videos about their potential candidates, ... hold any political end and if so, shouldn’t they be prohibited as well”.
 
The answer is simple. The Films Act clearly allows videos by potential candidates so long as its content relates to the party’s or candidate’s manifesto or ideology and is presented “without animation and dramatic elements”. On this basis, the video “Re-Ignite the Passion of Servant Leadership” is clearly allowed. On the other hand, the SDP’s video uses dramatisation to achieve a political end, and is thus disallowed.

                ","The Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act (CPFTA) protects you from unfair retail practices, and offers you an avenue to seek redress, should you need it.
 
 
There are 20 unfair practices specified in the second schedule of the CPFTA. Here are some examples, with comments provided by the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE).
 
 
Unfair practice
Scenario Example
To do or say anything, or omit to do or say anything, that will cause you to be misled or deceived
Mr. Tan purchased 2 smartphones from a retail store. He was asked to sign a document without being given the opportunity to read it. The document was not explained to him either. Mr. Tan was subsequently told to choose between paying a monthly warranty fee of $69.90 or $59.90. He was eventually charged the monthly warranty fee for a three year period. 
 
CASE’s Comments: By omitting to mention that the warranty fee would be payable upfront for a period of three years, the sales assistant failed to inform Mr. Tan on the actual cost of the handphone (with warranty). Further, by requesting that Mr. Tan choose between two warranty fees. The sales assistant would have led Mr. Tan to form the impression that the fees were “compulsory”.  
 
To make a false claim
 
False Claim Made Before The Transaction
Mrs. Lee purchased a brand new handphone from an online store. Upon delivery, she noticed that the set was refurbished, and not brand new as advertised. Mrs. Lee contacted the vendor, who provided multiple assurances that a new replacement unit would be provided. It never arrived. 
 
CASE’s Comments: By representing to Mrs. Lee that the handphone was brand new when it was not, the retailer would have made a false. Further, by providing multiple assurances that a replacement unit would be provided but repeatedly failing to follow-up, the retailer would have made another false claim in relation to the replacement of the unit. 
 
False Claim After the Transaction
Mr. Rahman engaged a renovation company to renovate his home for a specified sum. He was given a five-year warranty against defects. The warranty covered the new laminated flooring which was installed. 
 
A year after the renovation, the joints of the laminated flooring started to warp and sharp edges began to form. Mr. Rahman contacted the renovation company to rectify the matter, but was told that the warranty did not cover flooring defects. 
 
CASE’s Comments: By representing to Mr. Rahman that the warranty did not cover the flooring defects (when it did), the company would have made a false claim to Mr. Rahman in relation to the coverage of the warranty.
 
To take advantage of you when it’s obvious that you are not in a position to protect your own interests or are not reasonably able to understand the nature or effect of the transaction 
Mandy, a young teenager, purchased a beauty package from a slimming salon outlet. During one of her visits to the outlet, the sales consultants persistently pressured Mandy to purchase an upgrade. This sales pressure continued even while Mandy was undergoing treatment – when she was unclothed and strapped to the treatment machine. After repeated pressure, Mandy relented and agreed to purchase the upgrade. 
 
CASE’s Comments: It can be argued that the business had taken advantage of Mandy in two ways: First, Mandy is of a tender age. Second, Mandy was unclothed and undergoing treatment when the sales consultant obtained her agreement to purchase the upgrade. In both circumstances, Mandy was not in a position to protect her interest.

                    20 Aug 2015
                ","The Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act (CPFTA) includes a provision for a ‘lemon law’ - which provides additional rights to consumers for non-conforming goods. Non-conforming goods are those of a different quality, condition, type, etc. than that which was agreed upon during the transaction.
 
 
The lemon law protects consumers from retailers who sell defective goods. If a defect surfaces within 6 months of purchase, it is assumed that the defect existed at the time of sale, unless the retailer can prove otherwise. 
 
 
Should you encounter a lemon, you can pursue two stages of recourse: First, you can ask the seller to replace or repair the product within a reasonable period of time. If the seller is unable to do so, you can request a price reduction or a full refund. 
 
 
Here are some guidelines on the goods covered by the lemon law:

                    19 Feb 2018
                ","Yes, the Government takes the AGO findings very seriously. The lapses mentioned in the AGO findings are looked into by the heads of the respective agencies. In the case of Ministries, it would be the Permanent Secretary. 

Agencies will investigate, correct and implement measures to ensure that lapses are rectified and steps are taken to minimise recurrence. Where warranted, agencies will take disciplinary action against staff responsible for the any lapses. Disciplinary measures may include the withholding of the officer’s salary increment, or imposing a promotion debarment for several years. If there is suspicion of corruption or fraud, the matter will be referred to the Police for further investigation. 

Beyond the internal investigations and corrective measures undertaken by each agency, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) – comprising elected Members of Parliament – also examines the various accounts of the Government. The PAC  may ask agencies to submit documentation for areas of concern to the Committee. The Committee then gives its opinions and observations, including its assessment of the agencies’ follow-up action, to Parliament and to the public. 

All Government agencies and public officers are mindful that they have a duty to safeguard public funds.  The agencies will take prompt action whenever problems are found, and make no attempt to cover them up.

            ","
                    19 Feb 2018
                ","The Aljunied-Hougang-Punggol East Town Council (AHPETC) alleged that Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam said if the operating grant withheld by the Ministry of National Development (MND) for FY14/15 was disbursed, it still wouldn’t be enough to comply with the AHPETC’s Sinking Funds obligations for the year.
 
This is FALSE.
 
 
DPM Tharman didn’t make any statement on the AHPETC’s Sinking Fund obligations or whether it would be able to fulfil its obligations if the MND grant was disbursed. 
 
 
In his response to MP Sylvia Lim in Parliament, DPM Tharman had said: “Even if you take into account MND’s grant which MND is willing to discuss with you, and you have part of the MND grant that has to properly go into the sinking fund and another part which goes into the operating fund, the amount that is owed to sinking fund from the operating fund will not be solved by MND’s grant. That is a more fundamental problem.”
 
 
Aside from what AHPETC owes to its Sinking Fund for the last financial year, it also owes S$4.5 million for the quarter ending 31 July 2015. Another S$4.5 million will be due each quarter by October 2015, January 2016 and April 2016.
 
 
The MND previously indicated that it was prepared to disburse the S&CC grants in full to AHPETC, and to accede to its unusual request for the funds to be placed in the Sinking Fund account in full instead of being split between the Sinking and Operating Funds, as per the Town Councils Act and Financial Rules. While this would help, it would not fully cover the growing Sinking Funds deficit. 
 
 
MND made the offer of a half grant to AHPETC on 7 October 2014, and the offer of a full grant on 2 May, 15 June and 6 August 2015. The Ministry is waiting for AHPETC’s reply.

                ","All Singaporeans will be covered by MediShield Life when it rolls out on 1 Nov 2015. This includes overseas Singaporeans, who can return to Singapore for medical treatment at any time.
 
The Government will help all Singaporeans, including those based overseas, with their MediShield Life premiums.
 
Should you default on your premium payment, officials will reach out to you to understand the reason for the default. If the officials assess that you need additional help, they will invite you to apply for it, to reduce your premium payable. 
 
However, a small handful may choose not to pay their premiums despite having the ability to. Attempts will be made to recover the premiums from these individuals, through measures such as:  

Appointing defaulter’s agents (such as his employer, bank, tenant) to recover the outstanding premiums
Offsetting outstanding premiums against one-off Government surplus-sharing transfers (e.g. Growth Dividends)
Recovering from the defaulter’s CPF monies which are withdrawn in cash
Imposing travel restrictions in certain circumstances
Initiating legal action to recover the arrears
Recovering from the defaulter’s hospitalisation claim payout

Defaulters will NOT be arrested for failing to pay their MediShield Life premiums. 
 
However, those who have been told that they cannot leave the country until their premiums are paid, but still try to do so, will be arrested.
 
Premium recovery measures are needed, to ensure that all Singaporeans pay their share of premiums, and  that Medishield Life Fund continues to be available to all. Failure to do this will result in higher premiums for all.

Savings & Taxes,Why doesn't the Government increase social spending?,/factually/content/whydoesntthegovernmentincreasesocialspending,"
                Why doesn't the Government increase social spending?
            ","
                    19 Sep 2016
                ","It is sometimes suggested that the Government should increase its spending in areas such as healthcare and social welfare, to reduce the burden on citizens. 
 
 
But did you know that any increase in spending will have to be financed by taxpayers, through higher taxes or by cutting back on spending in other areas? 
 
 
Singapore’s approach to financing expenditure is to keep taxes low, while targeting assistance at those who need it most. This helps to ensure that finite resources go to those who need help most.  
 
 
Indeed, assistance to lower- and middle-income Singaporeans and the elderly has been increasing over the years – from enhanced healthcare subsidies to better social assistance benefits. 
 
 
Some have suggested that Singapore should follow the Scandinavian model which is based on a system of high taxes and comprehensive welfare benefits for all. 
 
 
But we need to understand that this comes at a cost - the highest personal income tax bracket in Sweden is just under 60%, compared to 20% in Singapore. This means that if you live in Sweden and are in the highest income tax bracket, you will be taxed almost 60 cents for one dollar earned, and take home just 40 cents. In Singapore, you would be taxed 20 cents, and take home 80 cents.  
 
 
The lower tax burden in Singapore enables us to take home more of our pay-check every month, and save more. 
 
 
Spending is popular, but raising money to pay for it is not. The Singapore approach targets help where it is needed, without imposing a heavy tax burden on all.

Transport & Motoring,Are lower income Singaporeans spending less on public transport?,/factually/content/arelowerincomesingaporeansspendinglessonpublictransport,"
                Are lower income Singaporeans spending less on public transport?
            ","
                    19 Feb 2018
                ","Yes, over the past decade, households in the lowest 20% income group have spent a decreasing portion of their income on public transport. 
This is because income growth has outpaced increases in public transport fares. There are also many transport initiatives that have helped to keep transport fares down.
Some of these initiatives would be:
1) Fare adjustment formula and fare cap
The fare adjustment formula protects commuters by capping fare increases. The fare adjustment may even be a reduction, if prevailing market conditions warrant it. 
Transport Minister Lui Tuck Yew has also announced a fare reduction of up to 1.9% at the end of this year, due to the fall in fuel costs. 
2) Fare concessions
Concessionary fares have been enhanced for students, National Servicemen, low-wage workers and persons with disabilities. Unlimited travel monthly passes have also been introduced for senior citizens and other adults.
3) Public Transport Fund and Public Transport Vouchers
Public transport operators are required to contribute a portion of any increased fare revenue to the Public Transport Fund, to help those affected by fare increases. Over 250,000 Public Transport Vouchers worth $30 each were distributed to low-income households from the proceeds of this Fund in 2014.
4) Public Transport Infrastructure
Infrastructure such as MRT/LRT lines and bus interchanges are funded entirely by the Government. Bus and train operators are only responsible for operations, maintenance costs and investments in service improvements. This ensures that infrastructural costs are not passed on to commuters.

            ","
                    19 Feb 2018
                ","There have been claims on some online websites that the Government will raise the GST after the forthcoming General Elections to fund increased spending planned in the next term of government. There is no basis to these claims, and they are inconsistent with what the Government has recently stated.  
 
In the 2015 Budget Statement in February, DPM Tharman Shanmugaratnam stated that the revenue measures the Government had already undertaken will provide sufficiently for the increased spending planned for the rest of this decade1. 
 
Budget 2015 introduced important revenue measures such as the inclusion of Temasek in the Government’s Net Investment Returns (NIR) framework from 2016 onward2, and the increase in the top marginal rates for personal income tax from Year of Assessment 2017. These measures came after moves in recent years to make Singapore’s property tax rates more progressive, with significantly increased tax rates for high value residential properties, offsetting reduced tax rates for lower value homes. 
 
In rounding up the 2015 Budget Debate, DPM Tharman stated, “We have prepared ourselves in advance and that must remain the way in which we plan for our budgets in the decades to come. With the change to incorporate Temasek in the NIR framework and the other tax changes I have introduced, in particular the increase in the personal income tax rate, we will be in a good position for at least the rest of this decade.”3 
 
The Government’s approach remains that of responding to changing circumstances and planning revenue measures in advance of Singapore’s future needs. Through this forward-looking approach, we have been able to meet the growing needs of our people in healthcare and invest in our future, while preserving fiscal sustainability and Singapore’s Triple-A credit rating.

2              There is no plan to build an underground city or underground residential developments to accommodate a “10 million population”.  Underground space has been developed to accommodate infrastructure such as MRT rail lines, utilities and storage spaces.

But did you know that the Government subsidises up to 80% of the cost of hospitalisations? This means that a huge part of your bill is taken care of by the Government. 
 

 When you fall sick, you will have subsidies and the 3Ms – Medisave, MediShield and Medifund – to help you with medical expenses.

Government Subsidies
Singaporeans receive heavy subsidies from the Government for medical care at public healthcare facilities: 


 
Singaporeans can also receive subsidised care at private GP and dental clinics, under the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS). 
 
 
Medisave
 
Medisave helps to reduce the amount of out-of-pocket cash when you or your loved ones are sick. The Government helps you build your Medisave nest-egg through top-ups, such as: 




MediShield/MediShield Life
 
MediShield helps you with large hospital bills and some costly outpatient treatments. When MediShield Life kicks in on 1 Nov 2015, it will offer better protection and higher payouts – reducing the portion of the bill that you need to pay directly.  
 
 
Medifund
 
Medifund helps Singaporeans who face difficulties with their hospital expenses, even after Government subsidies and the 3Ms. 
 

 
Pioneer Generation Package
 Pioneers will receive additional assistance with their healthcare costs for life, on top of the S+3Ms. These include higher subsidies for outpatient care, annual Medisave top-ups of between $200 – $800, and additional help with MediShield Life premiums.

                ","When can I call an SCDF Ambulance?

For someone needing urgent medical care, the speedy arrival of an ambulance can mean the difference between life and death.

The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) emergency ambulance service should hence only be called for emergencies, to enable care to be given to those who need it most critically. 

Indeed, calling 995 for non-medical emergencies can cost lives.

However, some continue to engage the SCDF’s ambulance service for non-emergencies.

In this Factually article, we debunk some of the myths associated with calling 995, and give you the low-down on the alternatives.

3 Common Misconceptions about the SCDF Emergency Medical Service

Myth 1: Patients arriving in SCDF emergency ambulances need not pay for the ambulance service

Reality: This is true – but only for emergency cases. Non-emergency cases will be charged an ambulance fee of $274*.

Myth 2: Patients can request SCDF emergency ambulances to send them to any hospital of their choice

Reality: This is false. SCDF emergency ambulances will convey patients to the closest designated restructured hospitals, to receive immediate medical attention. Ambulance personnel will not consider requests to redirect patients to alternative hospitals, even if patients have existing relationships with those facilities. 

Myth 3: Patients arriving in SCDF emergency ambulances receive priority treatment at the A & E Department

Reality: This is false. ALL patients arriving at A & E Departments will be assessed by medical professionals at the hospital at the point of registration. Those assessed to be most critical will be attended to first.

So, what should you do if you or a loved one needs medical care but it is not an emergency?

Seek medical advice from a family doctor or a hospital, using your own or public transport.  

If an ambulance is required, dial 1777 for a non-SCDF ambulance. You will be able to choose which hospital to be taken to.

While mostly a boon to business and workers, such changes may unfortunately also lead to skills becoming obsolete, if workers do not upgrade them. 
The good news? The Government is there to help – both in terms of providing training programmes to help workers upgrade their skills, as well as funding which not only covers the bulk of course fees, but in some cases also provides an allowance!
Pulling these initiatives into a cohesive whole is SkillsFuture - a national movement championing the Singaporean worker, which provides the framework for lifelong learning whether you’re still in school, an industry veteran, or deciding on a career path. Among its many benefits is SkillsFuture Credit, which provides $500 to all Singaporeans aged 25 and above, to offset the cost of education and training. 
Taken together, the various training programmes and funding assistance help to make training and acquiring new skills affordable and accessible for all, as part of the Government’s commitment to help Singaporeans maintain their competitive edge in today’s rapidly changing workplace. 
So, regardless of your current position or educational background, do take advantage of them to take your career to greater heights!

                What's this MERS-CoV that’s been in the news lately?
            ","
                    19 Feb 2018
                ","What is MERS-CoV?

MERS-CoV, or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus, is a novel coronavirus like SARS, and can cause acute respiratory illness in patients. 

Its symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Some infected patients also have diarrhea and nausea or vomiting. 

Unlike the average respiratory illness, however, a MERS-infected patient will experience more severe complications over time, such as pneumonia and kidney failure. 

The virus has an incubation period of 2 to 14 days, and it is believed that patients are not contagious during this period.

How severe are the symptoms?

The virus affects people differently. Some experience mild or no symptoms at all, and recover fully. About a third, however, succumb to the illness.

The virus appears to more severely affect people who are older, people with weaker immune systems, and people with chronic diseases as diabetes, cancer and chronic lung disease.

How does it spread?

First reported in 2012, all reported cases thus far have been associated with the Middle East and travelers to the region. 

The current outbreak in South Korea has attracted much attention. However, all cases can be traced to hospital contacts or family members, and there is no evidence of sustained community transmission.

Indeed, in all past cases, the virus has spread through close contact, such as through caring for and living with an infected person. 

Given this, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has not advised special screening at points of entry, and does not recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

What are the chances of MERS-CoV coming to Singapore? 

MERS-CoV cases have been reported in 25 countries to-date, including China, Malaysia, Korea and the Philippines. 

Given global connectivity, we cannot rule out the possibility of the virus arriving on our shores, despite the issuing of health advisories and temperature screening at border checkpoints for travellers arriving from affected countries. 

Indeed, PM Lee has said that it is ""just a matter of time"" before the first case is detected in Singapore. 

Singaporeans can be assured that our healthcare institutions are readying themselves for this eventuality. Our hospitals remain vigilant to test for MERS-CoV where clinically indicated, such as in patients with serious respiratory illness and travel history to affected countries. All suspected and confirmed cases will also be isolated and managed under strict airborne infection control precautions. If a case is detected, the Ministry of Health will conduct contact tracing when appropriate, and all close contacts will be placed under quarantine.

What should I do...

...if I want to avoid MERS?

As much as possible, don’t travel to affected areas (the Arabian Peninsula and South Korea). But if you do travel there, take steps to maintain good personal hygiene: wash your hands frequently and wear a mask in crowded places. Do not visit healthcare facilities in these areas unless absolutely necessary.

Avoid contact with camels and other live farm or wild animals. Be sure to consume clean food and drink – and be wary of undercooked meats, raw fruits and vegetables.

Additional precautions can be found in the Ministry of Health’s advisory on MERS.

...if I recently travelled to the Middle East or South Korea?

Monitor your health carefully for up to two weeks after your travel. If you develop a fever and cough or shortness of breath, call ahead to a healthcare provider and mention your recent travel before going down to a hospital or clinic. 

Be honest about your travel history, to enable our healthcare professionals to take appropriate precautions in your treatment, and provide accurate medical advice. 

Be socially responsible - Stay home from work or school, and delay future travel to avoid infecting others. 

...if someone I know recently travelled to the Middle East or South Korea?

If you have spent a prolonged period of time with them and you have had direct contact with infectious secretions (such as standing nearby when they cough), do keep a close watch on your health as well as theirs. If they have symptoms of respiratory illness, monitor your health for two weeks, starting from the day you last met the ill person. 

Should you develop similar symptoms, do call ahead to a healthcare provider and mention your contact with the traveler before going down to a hospital or clinic. Stay home from work or school, and delay future travel to avoid infecting others.

Myth #1: Singaporean PMETs are losing out to foreign PMETs in the job market
It’s a common concern that Singaporean Professionals, Managers, Executives and Technicians (PMET) are facing stiff competition from foreigners in the job market and losing out on a wide scale. If this is true, the unemployment rate of Singaporean PMETs would have increased over the years. However, statistics from Ministry of Manpower (MOM) shows that the unemployment rate of Singaporean PMETs have remained low at 2.9% in 2014.

Myth #2: Foreign PMETs are driving wages down

Another concern is that the presence of stiff competition from foreign PMETs would drive wages of Singaporean PMETs down across the board. However, MOM’s data shows that real median income growth, that is income growth adjusted for inflation, grew by about 2% per year between 2009 and 2014. 

Myth #3: The Government is not helping Singaporean PMETs

There are concerns that the Government is not doing enough to help Singaporean PMETs stay ahead in an increasingly competitive job market and changing business environment. This isn’t true.



First, the Government has gradually tightened the foreign PMET growth rate. The growth rate of foreign PMETs, usually on Employment or S Pass, have slowed down from 20% in 2011 to 4% in 2014 year-on-year.

Next, the Government has measures to ensure that companies based in Singapore adhere to fair employment practices. MOM takes a tough stance against discriminatory hiring practices and will thoroughly investigate each case. However, time is needed for due process to take its course.

Lastly, the Government is investing in Singaporean PMETs so that they can stay competitive and relevant in an ever-evolving business environment. The Government has increased the training and education subsidies for Ministry of Education (MOE) and Workforce Development Agency (WDA) funded courses to a minimum of 90%. This subsidy is available to all Singaporeans aged 40 and above. In addition, MOM has increased the basic monthly salary support for employers who hire Singaporean PMETs on the Professional Conversion Programme (PCP) to 90%. The PCP is targeted at PMETs aged above 40 who have been unemployed for 6 months or more.

            ","
                    31 May 2018
                ","
The People’s Association (PA) was set up to bring the Government closer to the people. Grassroots leaders (GRLs) are volunteers appointed by the PA to
serve in various grassroots organisations (GROs). As at July 2016, there are about 38,000 GRLs.


GRLs help to bring the people and government closer, gather feedback from residents, implement the government’s social programmes and help to explain
government policies to residents to the best of their ability.


Many people volunteer out of a desire to help others and contribute to the community. While they do not expect any returns, the Government offers GRLs some
recognition to facilitate their community work and to better enable them to continue with their community service:


Primary One Registration under Phase 2B


Eligible GRLs with two years of continuous and active service in GROs can apply for Primary One registration for their children under Phase 2B in schools
within the constituencies they reside in, together with others e.g. those who have served as school volunteers or are associated with the school. The rationale for this scheme is to promote greater collaboration between the schools and the community. The
experience and expertise of GRLs can be tapped by the schools to start community activities in their areas.


About 1% of GRLs apply per year and the majority of successful applicants continue serving in the GROs for many more years.


MND Grassroots Organisation Scheme


Eligible GRLs with three years of continuous and active service in GROs can apply for HDB BTO flats and Executive Condominiums under the Scheme. The
rationale for the scheme is to tap on experienced GRLs to start new GROs and activities in new estates. This is important as residents in new estates do
not know each other. Hence, the experienced GRLs can act as catalysts for community bonding.


Less than 1% of GRLs apply per year, and the majority of successful applicants continue serving in the GROs for many more years.


Car Parking at HDB Estates 

Our grassroots volunteers play an important role in our community outreach efforts.  They regularly help out in house visits, especially to the old and vulnerable who need assistance, as well as in organising community activities and dialogues to strengthen neighbourly ties. Our core volunteers often help out in the evenings and during weekends. To facilitate them in their community work, volunteers who drive may apply for a monthly HDB special parking label.  This special parking label allows them to park only in designated car parks within the area they serve, up to 11.00pm. To qualify for the special parking label, grassroots volunteers who live in HDB estates must first buy a residential season parking label.  Those who do not live in HDB estates must pay for the special parking label.

                ","
Factually answers two main questions on the recent Public Transport Fare Review Exercise for you.


1) Why are fares going up when oil prices are coming down?


When deciding whether to adjust fares, the Public Transport Council (PTC) uses a fare formula that reflects public transport operating costs.


The formula includes changes in consumer prices, average wages and energy costs. Energy costs, which had fallen in 2013, account for only 20% of the fare
adjustment quantum. During the same period, other operating costs (including salaries for bus drivers and other public transport workers), which make up
the remaining 80%, had gone up.


During the 2013 Fare Review Exercise, the PTC had considered a 6.6% fare increase based on the formula. To ease the burden on households, the PTC only
approved a 3.2% fare adjustment, or less than half of the 6.6%. The remaining 3.4% was carried over to 2014.


For the 2014 Fare Review Exercise, the adjustment factored in the 2013 figures. With lower energy prices but higher consumer prices and wages, the latest
calculation meant a 0.6% lowering of public transport fares. Taken together with the 3.4% that was carried over, the final fare adjustment the PTC had
considered and approved was 2.8%.


The falling oil prices in 2014 will be further reflected in the 2015 Fare Review Exercise. This means that fares may go down by around 1%, overall.


2) What’s being done for those who can’t afford the fares?


The PTC will always ensure that the impact from fare adjustments is kept to a minimum.


For the 2014 Fare Review Exercise, over 1.1 million commuters will be shielded from the fare increase:


To do more for those who can travel during off-peak hours, the Government will introduce new Off-peak Monthly Travel Passes in July. Commuters can save
more from buying these new passes which are priced at two-thirds the price of full-day passes.


In addition, the Government will give 250,000 Public Transport Vouchers of $30 each to help the needy families cope with the fare increase.

                ","The post ""MOM Report: Why media never say all unemployment rates increased?"" on The Real Singapore may have raised some doubts on MOM’s Labour Market Third Quarter 2014 report and the related Straits Times article. Not to fret, Factually is here to clear the air.
Clarification #1: Using different periods to compare unemployment change 
This is not true. The Straits Times actually reported the September 2014 overall and resident/citizen unemployment rates. The article also added that the overall unemployment rate was unchanged from March 2014 while resident/citizen unemployment rate was the same since June 2014. Also, seasonally adjusted unemployment rates have taken into account seasonal variations, such as students on vacation looking for work. This means that they can be compared across quarters. 

Clarification #2: All 3 unemployment rates increased
The TRS post mentioned that the overall, resident and citizen unemployment rates have increased by up to 0.2% percentage points. 
While the numbers quoted were accurate, the TRS post did not mention that the slight variations are possibly due to frictional unemployment. Frictional unemployment simply means that jobseekers are taking a longer time to find a best-fit job. It also did not point out that the unemployment rates for overall and resident/citizen remained low and steady in September 2014. Singapore’s long-term unemployment rates have also stayed low, a sign that unemployment is not due to economic shifts or lack of skills amongst job seekers.
Clarification #3: Data stranger by day?
The TRS post further alleged that while job vacancies have outpaced job seekers, the unemployment rates have increased. It cited that the ratio of job vacancies to job seekers rose to 142 vacancies for every 100 persons in September 2014 from 136 vacancies to 100 persons in June 2014.
This is not true as the comparisons are done over different periods. The vacancy to seeker ratio is compared over a quarter while unemployment rate is compared over the year. If we compare both figures over the year, the vacancy to job seeker ratio remains unchanged at 142 job vacancies per 100 job seekers in September 2014.

Since Oct 15, travellers from affected countries have been screened for temperature and exposure to EVD. These travellers are required to provide their Singapore contact details via a Health Declaration Card. Those with fever will be taken to Tan Tock Seng Hospital for further assessment while the ones identified to have been exposed to the virus will either be quarantined or put under surveillance, depending on their risk level. 
MOH has also taken additional steps such as distributing Health Advisory Notices to travellers from affected countries to raise awareness and ensuring hospitals, polyclinics and GP clinics remain vigilant against possible suspect cases. Medical practitioners have been instructed to practice strict infection control in the face of suspect or confirmed cases. Public hospitals also have infection control measures in place should an infection happen.
MOH will continue to work closely with their overseas counterparts and WHO to keep close tabs on the situation and ensure that public health in Singapore is safeguarded.

                ","
    Adapted from SAFRA


    Factually doesn’t think so. NSmen have been getting a bad rap with photos of NSmen doing inappropriate things while in uniform and other controversies
    surfacing online. Needless to say, social media have made it easier to reinforce these negative stereotypes that people may already have about our men in
    green. But are all these stereotypes deserved? These are 3 of the most common stereotypes about our soldiers to shake off!


Is it true that recruits don’t respect their uniforms?


    No. While it’s nothing new to see pictures of our NSmen doing weird things while wearing their uniforms posted online, it is important to note that context
    is key to understanding the whole situation. The difficulty arises when people rush to judge without knowing the full context. Let’s be mindful of what we
    say or post online. A little scepticism also helps.


Are NSmen misogynistic and disrespectful of women?


    No, although this may be the impression to anyone who has heard a platoon of NSmen marching to the tune of ""Purple Light"". The crude lyrics were even
    brought up by the Association of Women for Action and Research (AWARE) in a Facebook post last year.


    In response to the post by AWARE, there were many NSmen who were uncomfortable with the lyrics and voiced their agreement with AWARE. While MINDEF did not
    ban the song, they have taken steps to ensure that the offending lyrics will no longer be sung by our men in green.


Do NSF sergeants always vent their anger on recruits?


    While there may be plenty of stories circulating on social media about sergeants admitting that the only good thing about his role is his ability to vent
    his anger on recruits, do all NSmen take advantage of this just because they are having a bad day?


    The answer is no. Stress may come with every situation and unfortunately, there will always be one or two bad eggs who vent their frustrations others. Such
    behaviour isn’t applicable to everyone, even in the SAF. MINDEF has also strongly reiterated its adherence to its core values such as strong ethics and
    care for soldiers and to point out that such behaviour will not be condoned.

                    19 Feb 2018
                ","Here are some facts to set it straight:
What are the differences between elected MPs and NMPs?
The Singapore Constitution allows for three types of Members of Parliament (MPs): 
• elected MPs (MPs); 
• Non-Constituency MPs (NCMPs); and 
• Nominated MPs (NMPs). 
Unlike MPs and NCMPs who gain their seats through elections, NMPs are appointed by the President for a term of two and a half years on the recommendation of a Special Select Committee of Parliament. Singaporeans are invited to submit names of citizens to this Special Select Committee which will nominate up to 9 suitable candidates to the President for appointment as NMPs. 
NMPs have the same rights as the MPs to raise questions, suggest legislation and make their views and opinions heard by making speeches on all matters before Parliament. They are also allowed to vote on all matters before Parliament except the following:
• constitutional amendments
• motions to remove the President
• motions of no confidence in the government
• Supply Bills, and 
• Money Bills.
 
How are NMPs selected? 
Step 1: Singaporeans are invited to propose names of candidates to the Special Select Committee through advertisements and a press release to media. 
To be an NMP, candidates are subjected to the same qualifying criteria as an elected MP, which are: 
• Singapore citizen aged 21 years or above;
• Resident in Singapore for at least ten years;
• Name appears in the register of electors;
• Able to speak, read and write in at least one of the four official languages (English, Malay, Mandarin and Tamil); and
• Not disqualified from being an MP under Article 45 of the Constitution.
Step 2: The names are submitted to a Special Select Committee of Parliament for consideration. The Committee is chaired by the Speaker of Parliament and seven MPs. As of August 2014, the Committee is made up of Speaker Madam Halimah Yacob, Dr Ng Eng Hen, Ms Grace Fu, Ms Sim Ann, Dr Janil Puthucheary, Ms Ellen Lee, Mr Masagos Zulkifli Bin Masagos Mohamad, and Mr Low Thia Khiang. The full list can be found here.
When assessing the candidates, the Special Select Committee will consider whether they have rendered distinguished public service, brought honour to Singapore, or excelled in certain fields such as the arts, the sciences, business, community service or the labour movement. The Special Select Committee will also bear in mind the need for candidates to reflect as wide a range of independent and non-partisan views as possible. 
Step 3: From the names submitted, the Committee will recommend up to 9 names to the President for appointment as NMPs for a term of two and a half years. 
As of August 2014, 9 new NMPs have been appointed. They include:


Why do we need NMPs? 
NMPs in Parliament help to ensure a greater diversity of voices in the House. They contribute independent and non-partisan views in Parliament. As according to our constitutional laws, NMPs will have to vacate their seats if they decide to stand for elections.
NMPs represent the varied interests of a wider group of Singaporeans on other issues that might not otherwise get as much prominence in the House. For example, NMPs such as Ms Janice Koh, Ms Faizah Jamal and Mr Laurence Lien have voiced out on arts, environmental and social issues. Other noteworthy contributions from NMPs include the Maintenance of Parents Bill introduced by Prof Walter Woon and motions raised Mr Viswa Sadasivan.
Singaporeans who wish to find out more about the contributions of NMPs can check out the Singapore Parliament Reports and resumes of the current NMPs at the Parliament website.

                ","It is not true that the increase in the Vehicle Entry Permit(VEP) caused the alleged ""strike"" by Malaysian bus drivers on 1 August, as suggested by Tan Kin Lian in his Facebook post. The ""strike"" arose as a response to the new toll charges imposed by the Malaysian government on vehicles entering Singapore from Johor, and not because of the VEP increase. The VEP does not affect buses and taxis entering Singapore from Johor.
       Tan Kin Lian's Facebook Post
 
To understand why this is so, here are some facts on the different types of checkpoint fees that vehicles pay when crossing the Causeway:
 
#Myth 1: Vehicle Entry Permits affect all vehicles. 
VEP fees only apply to foreign-registered cars and motorcycles entering Singapore. It does not affect buses and taxis. 
There are also certain periods where these cars and motorcycles need not pay the VEP fee, namely: 


Vehicle Category
VEP Fees at both Tuas & Woodlands Checkpoints
Mondays – Fridays
            (2am – 5pm)*
Mondays – Fridays 
            (5pm – 2am*),
            Saturdays, Sundays and Singapore Public Holidays
Cars
S$35 per day
No VEP fee payable
Motorcycles
S$4 per day
 * During the Singapore mid-year and year-end school holidays, VEP operating hours will be shortened to end at 12 pm instead of 5pm. From LTA's website
 
Based on 2013 data, the VEP fee increase will only affect one in ten foreign-registered cars. The other nine in ten foreign-registered cars will not be affected by the VEP fee increase as they enter and stay in Singapore on VEP-free days or during VEP-free hours.
#Myth 2: The Vehicle Entry Permit (VEP), Goods Vehicle Permit (GVP), and toll charges all the same. 


#Myth 3: VEP, GVP are to generate more revenue for the Singapore government.
This is incorrect; the purpose of having the VEP and GVP is to help bring the cost of owning and using a foreign-registered vehicle in Singapore to the same level of costs to that of a Singapore-registered vehicle. If Singapore does not do this, we may just see more foreign-registered cars in Singapore clogging up roads.

                ","        HDB has a system in place to ensure that the quality of its new flats meet acceptable industry standards. They abide by a clear set of guidelines and impose quality checks at every stage of construction, including pre-and post-construction. 
For example, contractors are required to inspect completed flats and carry out the necessary rectification works to the full satisfaction of HDB's quality officers, before handing the flats over to HDB. Despite the stringent process, some minor imperfections may still remain due to the inherent features of natural minerals or the nature of construction works that are dependent on manual labour. 
As part of HDB's commitment to quality, HDB provides all new HDB flat owners with HDB's Assure 3 warranty coverage for ceiling and external wall seepage, and spalling concrete. This is in addition to the 1-year Defects Liability Period (DLP) for all new property owners to report defects for rectification, a timeframe similar to private sector developments. 
HDB advises new flat owners to inspect their flat and report any defects to their development's Building Services Centre (BSC) within the DLP. During this period, the BSCs are conveniently located near the new flats for owners to report defects for prompt follow up by the contractors. Subsequently, flat owners can report any defects to their HDB branch.
In general, defects reported are rectified within two weeks. In cases where the contractor requires more time, for reasons such as unavailability of materials, flat owners will be informed of the expected completion date. 
The issue of defects rectification can be made more trying and complex when there are differences in understanding and expectations. An imperfection may be seen as a defect, and this usually happens with home owners who expect their new flat to be in pristine condition. While this is understandable, adopting zero tolerance towards defects and imperfections is not a reasonable expectation.
A recent encounter with a flat owner over the level difference between the floor tiles in his new flat is a case in point. While the level difference between the floor tiles in his flat had met industry standards, he found it unacceptable despite several rounds of rectification, as he expected the laid tiles to be perfectly even.
Some flat owners may also report 'defects' that are actually imperfections that arise from the nature of the product or manufacturing process. For example, for floors with timber finishes, some owners have given feedback on the colour inconsistencies. As timber is a natural, organic product, the shade and grain of each strip of the timber will vary. It is thus not possible to acheive a perfectly homogenous look.
In the case of ceramic floor tiles, some owners have reported the gaps between the tiles as 'defects'. These gaps are not defects as such. Ceramic tiles are produced at high temperatures and the tiles will shrink upon cooling. The extent to which each tile shrinks may vary slightly. To accomodate the slight variations in dimensions, the tiles are laid with gaps in between, and cement grout is used to fill in these gaps.
HDB acknowledges that there are times when defects may still remain despite everyone's best efforts, HDB will make good on the defects caused by manufacturing lapses, or when the work is not up to standard. There are prevailing industry standards and practices which serve as objective arbiters for both public and private developments in cases of doubt and dispute.

                How are our expressways named?
            ","
                    19 Feb 2018
                ","Some of our expressways' names seem to be shortened based on the first letter of each word, for example, East Coast Parkway (ECP) and Pan Island Expressway (PIE). Yet other expressways such as the Bukit Timah Expressway are known as BKE and not BTE. Ever wondered why?
A Quora user wrote to LTA to find out.
Interestingly, the acronym for expressways is derived from the first letter of the first two syllables followed by the first letter of the last word. 
For example:
East Coast Parkway (ECP)
Pan Island Expressway (PIE)
Central Expressway (CTE)
Bukit Timah Expressway (BKE)
Ayer Rajah Expressway (AYE)
Two exceptions to this naming system are the Kallang-Paya Lebar Expressway (KPE) and the Marina Coastal Expressway (MCE).
The Kallang-Paya Lebar Expressway originated as two separate expressways in the Kallang and Paya Lebar areas. Since there were two areas involved, the first two letters of each area (Kallang and Paya Lebar) was used.
To better reflect the Marina Coastal Expressway's location along the southern coast of Singapore in the Marina area, it was decided that its name and acronym should contain the word ""Coastal"". If we had used the traditional naming system, we would get the acronym MRE, which would not give the public as good a sense of where the expressway is located. Hence, the naming of the expressway was abbreviated to MCE.

                Why does HDB allow flat owners to sublet their flat?
            ","
                    19 Jun 2018
                "," HDB flats are meant primarily for owner-occupation. The flexibility to sublet is an option open to those who are eligible, and who need to supplement their household income, such as retired seniors and families in need. 
There are, however, strict conditions in place to ensure that HDB flats are not exploited for profit-generating purposes right after purchase. For example, flat owners must obtain HDB's approval before they can sublet their whole flat, and ensure that their subtenants meet all eligibility criteria, and the non-citizen quota for subletting of flats. 
Another, important condition to be met is the Minimum Occupation Period (MOP), which refers to the period of time that flat owners have to occupy their flat physically, before being able to sublet. 
The number of flats that are currently being sublet forms only about 5% of the total number of home-ownership flats. This means that the vast majority of our flat buyers do purchase flats for occupation. 
However, some have abused this policy and its good intentions. There are occasional accounts about how some flat owners are treating their flats as investment vehicles and are renting them out for profit, with no or little intention of occupying them in person within the MOP. Those who do so in contravention of the rules face the prospect of losing their flat, as HDB takes a serious view on unauthorised subletting. In 2013, HDB carried out about 7000 flat inspections and took action against 17 flat owners for unauthorised subletting. This includes imposition of a penalty and repossession of flats. 
In January 2013, HDB also revised the subletting rules to disallow Singapore Permanent Residents (SPRs) flat owners from subletting their flats as the HDB flats sold to SPR households are meant to meet their housing needs and not to supplement their income.

                ","No, they do not have to pay any licence fee to NEA. 
Under the Street Hawking Scheme, a licence is given to hawkers who sell their goods at fixed locations in public spaces without paying any rent. Hence, activities such as peddling illegal goods or soliciting donations illegally would be considered as illegal hawking. 
For more information, NEA has also posted a clarification on their website:
A very small number Singaporeans and Permanent Residents, who had met stringent eligibility criteria, had been given street hawking licences under the Street Hawking Scheme. They sell specific approved items, such as newspapers, lottery tickets, ice-cream, nuts, crackers, canned drinks, costume jewellery, phone cards, toiletries, and tissue paper; and are required to display their licences when conducting their businesses. They are also required to peddle their wares at fixed locations in public places, with the support of Town Councils, which decide on the designated locations in order to ensure that street hawking activities do not adversely affect residents, businesses and other stakeholders in the vicinity. Since the Scheme’s introduction 14 years ago, the annual licence fee has remained unchanged at $120 a year (or $10 a month).
Street hawking may not always be the best solution for someone trying to make a living. In the long run, such persons could be better off picking up new skills through the various government-funded training programmes and seeking employment, or getting a proper stall in a hawker centre or other retail premises to secure a more stable repeat clientele. Any Singaporean who wishes to embark on hawking may rent a hawker stall from NEA. There are monthly tender exercises, and the lowest successful bids have been as low as $1 in some centres.
Local illegal hawkers in genuine financial difficulties are referred to social service agencies, Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs) and self-help groups. They can approach Workforce Singapore (WSG) Career Centres located island-wide for career and training advice and services to enhance their job search skills and employability. NEA also provides assistance with the stall application process if they wish to bid for a hawker stall.

                Top 4 CPF myths debunked
            ","
                    08 Sep 2015
                ","Edited on 8 September 2015-CPF monies are your money and this is a fact. You can use CPF monies for housing, healthcare and investments. There are guidelines for their usage.
Blogs such as The Heart Truths have made allegations about our CPF monies that are inaccurate or outright false. These are some of the myths they have perpetrated and the facts:
Myth 1: Singaporeans have the least adequate pension funds. 


Screen shot from 'The Heart Truths'

This is not true. 
Your CPF money is your nest egg upon retirement. The uniqueness of our system is that you can also use your CPF monies to pay for housing. Many Singaporeans have indeed done so and some have fully paid for their homes by the time they retire. The homes that we own are part of our retirement assets too, allowing us to save on rent while providing us with the option to sell our homes when we need to. 
When international studies on pension systems make comparisons across countries, they often ignore this fact. They paint an incomplete picture of what members have in their accounts. They do not take into account the fact that Singaporeans also have used their CPF monies to pay for their homes.  
For a more complete picture about our retirement funds adequacy, read our Factually article on this here. In fact, more recent studies published by OECD and Mercer in 2013 reflect higher income replacement rates and adequacy levels, even without considering property ownership. 
Myth 2: When I use my CPF money to pay for my HDB flat, I have to pay CPF Board (CPFB) back the accrued interest if I ever sell my HDB flat. Essentially, I am paying “extra interest” for nothing. 
Many Singaporeans know that we can use our own CPF monies ( which is our savings) to pay for a HDB flat as this can serve as another form of asset for retirement needs. 
However, when we use CPF monies to buy a home, we are borrowing money from our own nest egg, which is meant for other retirement needs as well. 
Hence, it is only right that if we were to sell our home, we should return what we have borrowed (i.e. the principal amount) plus the interest we would have earned had the money not been taken out from our CPF account (accrued interest). This amount is returned to our own CPF accounts for our future retirement needs. 
Accrued interest needs to be refunded to our CPF accounts upon the sale of our home as long as the sales proceeds is sufficient to pay back the principal and interest.
 
Myth 3: Singaporeans get very low interest rates for our CPF savings. Moreover, we are paying an ""implicit tax"" as the returns on CPF monies invested by Temasek Holdings and GIC are not given back to Singaporeans.  
Our CPF funds are invested in risk-free Special Singapore Government Securities (SSGSs). The returns on SSGSs are pegged to the returns of other bonds in the market with similar risks. There is no connection between GIC's rate of return and the interest paid on our CPF accounts. GIC invests our foreign reserves in stocks, bonds, real estate and other assets that carry higher risks than SSGSs. The value of SSGS is assured, as they are guranteed by one of the few remaining triple-A credit-rated governments in the world. With our CPF funds being invested in SSGSs, we can be absolutely certain our funds will be there when we need them. 
CPF interest rates are guaranteed and risk-free. The interest is paid whether or not the Government’s investments backing its liabilities to CPF, including investments managed by GIC, do well or not. So if GIC's investments actually lose money, as they did during the Global Financial Crisis of 2008-09, CPF members will still get the 2.5% interest on our funds in the Ordinary Account. 
Finally, apart from the CPF system, it should be remembered that we Singaporeans benefit from GIC’s and Temasek’s returns though these are not linked to the returns we get on our CPF funds. GIC's and Temasek's returns supplement the annual Budget through their  Net Investment Returns Contribution (NIRC), which amounted to $8.1 billion this fiscal year. This money allows our Government to make further investments for our future, such as in education, R&D, healthcare and improving our physical environment. 
Aside from the return on our Ordinary Account, Singaporeans enjoy higher interest rates on their other CPF accounts- 4% on our Special, Medisave and Retirement Accounts, and an additional 1% on their first $60,000 in all our accounts:

Myth 4: The Retirement Sums are adjusted to prevent us from using our CPF money. 
This is not true. The retirement sums are adjusted on an annual basis for each cohort. This is necessary because the retirement income needed in real terms for someone who turns 55 in 2015 will not be the same as what would be needed for someone who turns 55 in 2025. $100 today would be worth less than $100 in 10 years’ time.
Considering that the price of your favourite kopi or kaya toast would keep increasing due to inflation, it helps to set aside a sustainable nest egg. 
The retirement sums exist to ensure that our nest egg is spread out comfortably to last us not just for one or two years after retirement, but throughout our golden years. When planning for retirement, we should think about how much we need in order to retire the way we want to, and set aside the money for it. This is what the retirement sums are for.
Recognising that people have varying retirement needs, the Government is introducing some flexibility while keeping your retirement adequacy in mind. From 2016, you can choose from three different payout options that best suit your needs, and set aside the corresponding retirement sum – the Basic Retirement Sum, Full Retirement Sum or Enhanced Retirement Sum.


If you own a property and choose to pledge your property.
$660 - $720
Basic Retirement Sum (BRS)
$80,500
If you do not own a property or choose not to pledge your property.
$1,220 - $1,320
Full Retirement Sum (FRS)
$161,000
The FRS is 2 x BRS. 
If you wish to put more savings in CPF LIFE.​
$1,770 - $1,920
Enhanced Retirement Sum (ERS)#
$241,500
The ERS is 3 x BRS.

The adjustments will not affect the retirement sums of people who have already turned 55. If you will be turning 55 from 2016 to 2020, here are your estimated CPF LIFE monthly payouts from the Basic Retirement Sums:

                    19 Jun 2018
                ","This is to guard against flat buyers purchasing a unit priced beyond their current financial capabilities, which might mean they risk losing their flat should they default on payments subsequently. Flat buyers are advised to consider their options before proceeding with the purchase, and to be aware of these key points when taking a loan:
1) HDB Loan Eligibility 
As not everyone is eligible for an HDB concessionary loan, it is advisable to check on loan eligibility as early as possible. This will help applicants work out a housing budget and enable them to make an informed decision when purchasing a flat. More details on the criteria for an HDB concessionary loan on the HDB InfoWEB.
2) Credit Assessment 
HDB requires relevant documents such as the applicant's payslip, CPF and bank statements and Credit Bureau reports to assess their credit position. For non-salaried workers, they would need to have an established employment record, and a regularly built-up pool of savings. 
On 27 August 2013, HDB also introduced revised mortgage loan terms that are in-line with the credit policy of the Monetary Authority of Singapore. These measures also encourage greater financial prudence, and impress upon buyers the importance of choosing a flat within their financial means. It also prevents them from overleveraging the current low interest rate environment and overstretching themselves in the long-run. 
How much loan can one take now? 
Monthly instalments 
The monthly instalments of an HDB concessionary loan are capped at 30% of joint applicants' monthly income. In some cases, the percentage is lower because of the family's financial commitments. This prevents buyers from over committing to housing at the expense of other living costs.
Repayment Period
This is capped at 65 years minus the buyer's age, or 25 years, whichever is shorter.
Mortgage insurance 
If CPF savings are used to pay the monthly housing loan instalments, one can apply for the Home Protection Scheme. This is an insurance administered by the CPF Board. It insures CPF members and their families against losing their homes should members become permanently incapacitated or pass away before their housing loans are paid up.

                ","Ever wondered about the Singapore Budget Process?
 Here’s a look at what you need to know: 
1. The Singapore Budget is prepared for each financial year, which begins on 1 April of every calendar year and ends on 31 March of the next calendar year.
The Budget includes the revised government
revenue and expenditure projections for the current financial year, as well as
the planned government revenue and expenditure in the coming financial year.
Before drawing up the Budget, MOF starts its
public consultation process in November to gather feedback for the next
financial year’s Budget. 
The feedback process generally lasts for about
two months, and all views and suggestions submitted during the feedback period
are taken into account in the design of the Budget. After which, the Budget is
presented to the Cabinet for approval. 
Watch a video on how the Budget is approved in
Parliament here:
 
2. The Government’s operating revenue is approximately 15% of GDP with the bulk coming from Corporate Income Tax, Personal Income Tax and the Goods and Services Tax.


 3. Singapore is required under the Constitution to keep a balanced budget over each term of Government. Unlike many other countries, Singapore does not borrow money to fund expenditure.

            ","
                    19 Feb 2018
                ","These are the new
measures that have been introduced to help keep public transport affordable for
those who need it most:

Who decides if public transport fares should be raised
or lowered? 

Changes to public transport fares
are not decided by the Public Transport Operators (PTOs) or the Government, but
by the Public Transport Council (PTC), which comprises members from the public
service, business community, academia, labour unions and grassroots
organisations. One of its duties is to regulate bus and train fares, in order
to ensure that any fare adjustments are reasonable and in the public interest,
while keeping in mind the long-term viability of the PTOs. 
So what is the Fare Review Mechanism Committee (FRMC) then? 
The FRMC is a separate committee
which reviews and proposes recommendations on the fare adjustment formula and
concessionary framework. The PTC’s role is to review these recommendations and
decide whether to accept them. 
Formed in June 2012, the
FRMC comprises members from the public and private sectors. It conducted its
review in consultation with the following stakeholder groups:
 


In its report released in
November 2013, the FRMC proposed several key changes:
 The report was accepted by the Government
in November 2013. 
So the PTC based the fare review on this new formula from the FRMC? 
Yes. While the fare cap for 2012 was calculated based
on the formula an earlier FRMC proposed in 2005, the fare cap for 2013 was calculated
using the latest formula, which amongst other changes, takes into consideration
energy costs (electricity and diesel) as well as the operators’ productivity
levels. The maximum total fare adjustment allowed is 6.6%. 
After considering the applications from the Public
Transport Operators, the
PTC granted a fare adjustment of 3.2%. The remainder will be rolled over and
considered as part of the 2014 Fare Review Exercise.

            ","
                    21 May 2015
                ","When elections are held in Singapore, the Elections Department follows the procedures laid out in the law to ensure the integrity of the election. 
There is a rigorous process to ensure the security of your vote and voting secrecy at each election. There is no break in the chain of custody of ballot papers from the polling station to the counting centre, and from the counting centre to the Supreme Court where the ballot papers are retained in safe custody for 6 months and then subsequently destroyed.For transparency, the process is open to observation by candidates and their agents who are present. 
Previously, used empty ballot boxes were found in a school which served as a counting centre. Following from this incident, there have been questions about the procedures. Here are some facts:
1. What are ballot boxes? 
Before polling commences at 8 a.m.
These boxes are marked and are shown to be empty to candidates and their polling agents who are present before they are sealed by election officials at the polling station before the start of the polls on Polling Day.  
After polls close at 8 p.m.

After the polls have closed, election officials at the polling station seal these ballot boxes containing the ballot papers which have been cast.  Candidates and their polling agents who are present witness the process and may also place their own seals on the ballot boxes.  The sealed ballot boxes carried by the election officials are then transported under Police escort to the counting centre.  A police officer is on board the bus used and stands guard over the ballot boxes throughout the journey.  
Counting of votes 
At the counting centre, before the ballot boxes are opened, candidates and their counting agents who are present may inspect all the boxes again to ascertain that all the boxes are accounted for, and that no others are present; and that the seals of all the ballot boxes are intact and have not been tampered with.  The seals are then broken and ballot boxes are opened, and the ballot papers therein are poured out, sorted and counted.  The emptied ballot boxes are ascertained in the presence of all to be empty. 
After annoucement of election results 
After the election result has been announced by the Returning Officer, the ballot papers and other official documents used in the election are placed into separate boxes and sealed, witnessed by candidates and their counting agents who are present, who may also place their own seals on these boxes.  The emptied ballot boxes are put aside with other discarded material to be collected by the Elections Department’s contractor for general disposal.
2. What is the process like? 
3. So why were empty boxes still found? 
The empty ballot boxes set aside at the counting centres are to be disposed of by a contractor appointed by the Elections Department, along with any other items such as lanterns or unused writing material. This should be done the day after Polling Day. Should the contractor be unable to collect all or any of the items on that day, these items are then kept in a storeroom for the contractor to collect at another date. 
The discovery of the used empty boxes suggest that there was an oversight by officers involved in the collection of such discarded material after Polling Day. This does not constitute a lapse in the election procedures that ensure the integrity of our election process. The Police investigations also showed that there is no offence disclosed under section 37 of the Presidential Elections Act, which relates to the tampering of ballot boxes before and while in use during the election period. 
In order to avoid similar incidents in the future that may cause undue alarm and confusion, the Elections Department will study how to tighten the process of collecting and disposing of such discarded material in a way that is practical and not onerous.

                    19 Feb 2018
                ","The repatriation of 57 migrant workers for their involvement in the recent Little India Riot has led to some questions about whether the Government has the right to make such a call and if there has been due process in the decision.
Functions of our Judiciary and Executive
Before we look at these questions, we have to first understand how the system in Singapore works. Our system assigns different functions to the Judiciary (the Courts) and the Executive (the Cabinet/Government). Criminal charges and civil claims are adjudicated before the courts, while matters of security, assessment of risk and immigration matters, among others, are decided by the Government. 
This means the Executive was involved in the decision to repatriate the foreign workers, and this decision was made in accordance with the written laws, to protect Singaporeans and to ensure that Singapore remains a safe and peaceful place. Our Government is legally empowered to make the necessary assessment and decision to repatriate foreign workers who have posed a threat to our safety and security. This is provided for under Section 8(3)(k) and 33 of the Immigration Act and Regulation 17 of the Immigration Regulations.
Foreigners work here with permission of the State
The immigration and employment laws of Singapore do not give foreigners an automatic legal right to work and stay in Singapore. Work passes are issued in accordance with the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act and the Immigration Act. The existing legal framework provides the Government with the legal power to cancel the work passes issued to the foreigners and repatriate them if it assesses that it is not in Singapore’s best interests for the person to remain here. Foreign workers choose to come into Singapore with the understanding that they have to abide by the laws of Singapore and, if they were to breach this condition, their work passes may be cancelled and they would be repatriated.
Our laws allow the Government to take firm and decisive action to minimise the risk of similar incidents recurring. The Immigration Act does not require the repatriation of foreigners to be ordered by the court. The Government recognises that the safety and security of its citizens come first. If court processes were necessary before a foreigner can be repatriated, these workers would stay on in Singapore for a considerable period until a court decision is made. If allowed bail, they would either be free to live within our communities despite being a security threat or, if they cannot afford bail, remain detained in our prisons for a prolonged period to await the conclusion of the court proceedings. This would not serve both Singapore and the foreigner’s best interest. 
These are not just theoretical possibilities. Examples from other countries have shown that the repatriation process can take years and, in some countries, repatriation is almost impossible. These rules may seem strict, but they also serve as a deterrent against those who may be contemplating flouting the law. Other countries with laws similar to ours include the UK, Australia, Hong Kong and Malaysia.
Against this backdrop, it is only natural that Singapore retains the right to protect herself against the occurrence of such incidents.
Due process in Executive decision-making
However, it does not mean that if the courts are not involved in the repatriation decisions, that there is no due process. Investigations were carried out and all factors and findings were considered before any decision was made to cancel the work passes of the foreign workers and repatriate them. The Police had interviewed more than 4,000 workers and investigated 400 in the aftermath of the Little India riot before a decision was made based on culpability that 25 would face charges, 57 would be repatriated and about 200 issued advisories.  This was a carefully considered and calibrated decision taken by the Government following an immense effort. Additionally, in terms of due process, the Indian and Bangladeshi High Commission were given full access to those who were charged and repatriated. The Committee of Inquiry also met some of them prior to their repatriation. Legal counsel was also accorded to those who were charged in court.
If charges were dropped, why were some workers still repatriated?
For the 4 workers who had their charges dropped, there have been questions if this meant that they were not involved in the riots and if so, why were they still repatriated? 
The Prosecution has the discretion as to whether these men should be prosecuted in Court for their actions in the riot. In this case, after further review, the prosecution decided not to proceed with charges against 4 workers, and withdrew the charges against them. When a charge is withdrawn, the usual order made by the court is a discharge amounting to an acquittal. Since the charge is not proceeded with, there is no trial and hence no findings of guilt or innocence in relation to the charge.
However, the decision not to charge these 4 workers for specific offences does not mean that they were not involved in the riot at all. It also does not preclude the government from exercising its powers under the Immigration Act. In this case, the Police identified the 4 workers for failing to disperse despite orders from the Police. Hence, similar to the 53 others, they had threatened public order and this made their continued presence in Singapore undesirable. They were issued warnings and were repatriated.

                ","The Asia Sentinel recently published an article on 12 Dec 2013, which claims that the Breakfast Network was banned by the Media Development Authority of Singapore (MDA). However, this claim is erroneous. Let's look at some of the claims:
Claim #1: ""Singapore's Media Development Agency has shut down its first Internet site, an innocuous fledgling called the Breakfast Network that was run by Bertha Henson, a former journalist with Singapore Press Holdings who now is a journalist in residence at a local college while acting as a media consultant.""
This is false.
The Breakfast Network shut down because its editor and owner chose not to register, which means that it would not be making the necessary declarations that it would not receive foreign funding, as required by MDA. MDA therefore informed the company that it should cease to operate its online services.  
The Breakfast Network was asked to register because it had ceased to be a personal blog or website, but had incorporated itself as the Breakfast Network Pte Ltd. As a corporate entity, Breakfast Network Pte Ltd had a greater possibility of coming under foreign influence via foreign funding. This registration requirement was simply to ensure that Breakfast Network would not receive foreign funding. 
Claim #2: “The action was taken under media guidelines published in May that required all Internet sites to register with the government if they have 50,000 unique visitors a month. They must put up S$50,000 bond if they report more than one article a week on Singapore-related news over a period of two months. If the government objects to an article, it must be taken down within 24 hours.”
The Independent had on 18 Dec, published a letter from Maruah which questioned the inconsistency of MDA's measures to prevent foreign influence in local media; ""The application of MDA's policy to prevent foreign influence in the media is also inconsistent, given Yahoo! is US-owned and it is individually licensed.""
Yahoo! and Breakfast Network come under different requirements. Unlike Yahoo!, the Breakfast Network was never required to obtain a licence under the Online News Licensing Scheme, which was introduced in June 2013. MDA simply required Breakfast Network to register under the Class Licence Framework.  This registration requirement of Breakfast Nework is not the same as MDA's Online News Licensing Scheme.
For Class Licence Framework:
There are two categories of class licence - Automatic, and via Registration. Breakfast Network was already automatically class licensed. But since Breakfast Network is a political website operated by corporate entity and therefore susceptible to foreign funding, MDA required it to register and to undertake not to receive foreign funding. 
For Online News Licensing Scheme
This scheme requires that news sites which report regularly on Singapore’s news and current affairs and have high reach, be individually licensed.  The two key conditions of the individual license, are that a S$50,000 bond must be put up, and a site is expected to comply within 24 hours to MDA’s directions to remove content that is found to be in breach of Singapore’s content standards. 
The Online Citizen (TOC) had on 12 Dec 2013, published a commentary on the registration of the Breakfast Network, which have put forth certain claims that were untrue as well. 
Claim #3: “It (MDA) apparently has come up with a rather onerous set of forms which websites who are asked to register must fill up. And according to Breakfast Network, the numerous registration forms it was required to submit to the MDA were different from the ones posted on the MDA’s own website.” TOC also quoted several claims made in TechinAsia’s article i.e. :


Breakfast Network claimed the requirements were onerous, citing the need to register volunteer contributors. MDA issued a statement on 13 Dec 2013, clarifying that at no point was Breakfast Nework told that contributors also need to register. They were only told that editors, including pro bono editors, had to register. As for the reporting of revenue sources, MDA informed Breakfast Network that they could suggest alternative ways of providing the required information.

Secondly, nothing has changed for Internet Content Providers. They continue to operate and publish under the existing class licence framework which has
been in place since 1996. Under this framework, certain groups such as political associations and political websites have always been required to register
with MDA, and fill up the form which is on MDA's website.


However, up until now, the registration requirement did not come with an undertaking not to receive foreign funds. This is because up until now, the
political websites which had to register were also gazetted as political associations, which meant that they were already prohibited from receiving foreign
funds under the Political Donations Act. As pointed out in the article, The Online Citizen (TOC) was gazetted as a political association under the
Political Donations Act. This means that TOC would become subject to restrictions on foreign funding as stipulated in the Political Donations Act.

                What are the facts of the rioting incident at Little India on 8 Dec?
            ","
                    19 Feb 2018
                ","There has been much speculation about the recent riot incident at Little India on 8 Dec 2013. However, not all information that you read online is true. Here are some facts:
When and how did the police respond to the incident?
On 8 Dec 2013, a fatal traffic accident occurred involving a private bus and a foreign worker, Sakthivel Kumaravelu, at the junction of Race Course Road and Hampshire Road. [ADDENDUM AS AT 13 FEB 2014: Further investigations established that the actual location of the accident was at the junction of Tekka Lane and Race Course Road. These findings were released on 11 Feb through the Attorney-General's Chambers following their review of investigative papers on the incident.]* Mr Sakthivel was believed to be drunk at the time and tried to board the bus which was already full.
*Last updated: 13 February 2014



Were there people injured as a result?
37 Police Officers, 5 Auxilliary Police Officers and 12 SCDF Officers sustained injuries and lacerations during the riot. The driver of the private bus, a 55- year-old Singaporean, and his 38-year-old timekeeper were also injured.
Contrary to some online reports, Mr Sakthivel was not decapitated. He was pronounced dead at the scene as a result of the traffic accident.
16 Police cars and 9 SCDF vehicles were also damaged during the riot.
Who was involved in the rioting?
A total of 420 persons were called up for investigations, in connection with the rioting incident. Persons charged were found to have committed acts of violence, damaged property, defied police orders or incited others to do so. Out of the 28 persons who face charges under Section 147 of the Penal Code, three of them have had their charges withdrawn upon further investigations by the police as of 23 Dec. The 25 accused have been granted bail. If bail is raised, they will have certain restrictions imposed on their movements. Those who are unable to raise the bail will be remanded in Prison.
A total of 57 persons have been identified for participating in the riot and for failing to disperse despite orders from the Police. These persons were granted consular access. 53 were originally identified in this group and as of 20 Dec, four more persons, who had their charges withdrawn earlier, have been added. These 57 persons have been repatriated and are prohibited from returning to Singapore.
In addition, another 200 persons were also present at the scene, but whose involvement have been assessed to be passive. They will be issued a formal Police Advisory and no further action will be taken against them.*
A foreign news outlet had incorrectly reported that an Indian national had been pushed out of a bus and was killed instantly. They also reported that Singaporeans and Chinese nationals had attacked the foreign Tamils, resulting in the escalated riot situation.
This is NOT true. Mr Sakthivel passed away as a result of being knocked down by the private bus. Singapore’s High Commissioner to India has written to India’s Sun TV Network to request for an immediate correction. They have since apologised and aired a corrected version of its report.
*Last updated: 23 December 2013

Did the police resort to violence when handling the incident?
No shots were fired. Police officers displayed maximum restraint and did not fire any weapon throughout the incident. Their main objective was to contain the situation and minimise any injuries to all present, particularly innocent bystanders.
So what’s happening next?
The Police have substantially completed investigations into the riot as of 17 Dec. 25 subjects were charged in court as of 23 Dec. The Police will continue to monitor the situation at Little India.
Investigations
The bus driver involved in the initial accident has been arrested as well for Causing Death by Negligent Act. He has been released on bail, pending further investigations.
COI
PM Lee has called for a Committee of Inquiry to look into the factors surrounding the incident, and how the incident was handled on the ground. It will also look at measures to manage areas where foreign workers gather.
Anyone with information on the riot should come forward and contact the Police. Information can also be submitted at www.spf.gov.sg/CrimeStopper.
Alcohol Ban and Bus Services**
A ban on consumption of alcohol at public places (e.g. at void decks, open areas) in Little India will be in effect every weekend, public holiday and eve of a public holiday, until the Committee of Inquiry makes its recommendations.

Retail and wholesale licence holders (e.g. liquor shops) are allowed to continue selling alcohol but only from 6am to 8pm on weekends, public holidays and eve of public holidays.
This will not affect the consumption and sale of alcohol at other public houses with licences (e.g. hawker centres, coffee shops, restaurants) as long as the alcohol is consumed within the premises.
As for bus services, the 25 Little India Bus Services run by private bus operators will resume operation from Sunday, 22 Dec 2013, but at half the number of scheduled buses. They will also only operate from 2pm to 9pm instead of the previous 2pm to 11pm schedule.

                ","Concerns have surfaced about the accuracy and timeliness of the information regarding cyber security put out by IDA. Want to know what happened? These are the facts:  
(1) Timeliness of information about scheduled maintenance 
A blogger from the blog ""Thoughts of a Cynical Investor"" had wrote that the clarification about the maintenance delay on 2 November 2013 (Saturday), was only released by IDA on Monday 4 November. Is this true? 

 
This is NOT true. IDA has always scheduled regular maintenance to ensure the security of government websites. When there were delays in the maintenance process on 2nd November 2013 (Saturday), a clarification was posted on IDA's Facebook Page on the same day, and not on 4 Nov as claimed.
 
 

 
 
(2)  Reporting of accurate information about cyber threats 
Similarly, IDA also put timely information when the PMO and Istana websites were compromised. 

  
In addition, information contrary to reports that the fault lay within the search bar, what IDA had mentioned was that    ""a vulnerability in those sub pages was exploited to display pages from other source. This vulnerability is know as cross-site scripting"". 
 
 (3)  Updating the public about website maintenance 
Information on when maintenance is scheduled are readily available. For example, the scheduled maintenance for CPF's website on 8 November was announced prior to that and carried out on government websites as well. 
 


 
 
 (4)  General information about cyber security 
IDA also educates the public about cyber security through http://www.gosafeonline.sg/ , which provides resources and materials on how we can protect ourselves and our online properties. 
The public can also check out IDA's social media platforms for more information and updates.

                ","Under the Singapore's consitution, everyone is allowed legal counsel and representation. 
Where a person is arrested, he shall be informed as soon as may be of the grounds of his arrest and shall be allowed to consult and be defended by a legal practitioner of his choice. – Article 9(3) of the Singapore Constitution
However, this does not mean that one would have access to a lawyer immediately ( i.e. when the person is arrested).  The Constitution itself does not stipulate when an accused is entitled to consult a legal practitioner, and how the Constitution should be interpreted is established in court cases. 
 In fact, in the case of Jasbir Singh v PP (1994) 1 SLR(R) 782, it was established that what Article 9(3) means is an arrested person is to be granted access to a lawyer within a reasonable time from his arrest. However, what is meant by “reasonable time” must be balanced with time needed by the police to carry out the investigation of the case effectively.  
In essence, when determining the rights of access to legal counsel, both the individual's rights and the police's role in protecting the larger public are considered.

                What was the cause of disruption to Government websites on 2 November ?
            ","
                    19 Feb 2018
                ","Some Government websites became temporarily inaccessible on 2 November 2013, and many have questioned if this was due to hacking attempts, such as a Distributed Denial of Service attack (DDOS attack). A DDOS attack occurs when attempts are made to render an online service unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic from multiple sources.
The cause of the disruption was a combination of a routing issue and a hardware failure that occurred during maintenance.
Was maintenance really planned on that day?
Yes.
Maintenance of websites takes place frequently, and is generally conducted during off-peak periods when there are fewer visitors to the sites.
The 2 November maintenance was brought forward, after threats were made to attack the government’s IT infrastructure and websites. It was not expected to affect access to the websites, but unfortunately, due to the routing issue and hardware failure, access was disrupted for around 2 hours.


Is maintenance still on-going for government websites?
Maintenance is an on-going process to enhance security measures for the Government’s websites, and while maintenance is in progress, some websites may still face intermittent access.
If access to the sites is expected to be affected, the relevant ministries will make an announcement.


Is the claim by “Messiah” that they are responsible for the downtime of government websites correct?
It is untrue.
On 5 November, Yahoo! Singapore reported that “The Messiah”, as part of a group called “Anonymous”, claimed responsibility to its reporter, for the downtime faced by government websites on 2 November.



Yet, on the day of the incident itself (2 Nov), a site which has been reporting statements from the same “Messiah”, said specifically that they were not responsible.



We leave readers to judge for themselves, why there should be two such inconsistent statements from reportedly the same persons.

The article reported that KKH and Gleneagles Hospital have implemented the RFID system for better identification of babies in July and September this year respectively but that only Gleneagles Hospital, a private hospital, charges $15 for the service.
This identification system works by issuing matching RFID tags to the mother, baby and the cot. If a baby is placed into the wrong cot or passed to the wrong mother, an alarm will sound, whereas a chime is emitted when the infant is matched to the correct cot or mother.
KKH has contacted the websites spreading the false claims and several sites have since updated their posts with KKH’s response.

For instance, we should focus on the income growth among the full-timers when doing analysis, so that these figures are not skewed by those who are part-timers.  


CPFB’s data in its annual report provides information on employees with CPF contributions, but it does not go into the finer details such as breaking down the figures into those who are full-timers and part-timers. To avoid such confusion, CPFB’s Annual Report no longer includes information on income. Those who are looking for an authoritative source of information on income should refer to MOM’s annual Report on Labour Force in Singapore.

Mercer, for example, has acknowledged that the CPF is designed to address a broader range of needs such as home ownership and medical costs than their index seeks to measure.  The CPF has helped the vast majority of Singapore households own their homes. With a roof over their heads, retirees not only save on rent in their old age, they also own an asset that is likely to appreciate in value over time and can act as a hedge against inflation.

                Unemployment in Singapore
            ","
                    19 Feb 2018
                ","There have been questions about Singapore’s unemployment numbers recently. Here are the facts about unemployment in Singapore:
What do “seasonally adjusted” and “non-seasonally adjusted” mean? Why do we use both to report unemployment numbers?
Simply put, non-seasonally adjusted data are the “raw” numbers, while seasonally-adjusted data remove the impact of seasonal influences on the data, such as fresh graduates entering the job market typically in June.
Seasonal patterns exist in unemployment, making it difficult for us to tell if changes in unemployment are true reflections of the economic conditions. To present a more accurate picture, we adopt a technique used by most national statistical agencies to produce seasonally adjusted data that will enable us to observe the underlying trends more clearly. 
To learn more about using seasonally adjusted unemployment data, you can view this video
Why is Singapore’s non-seasonally adjusted unemployment rate typically higher in June compared to other periods of the year?
In Singapore, unemployment is typically higher in June, because that’s when fresh graduates enter the labour market and students on holiday look for vacation jobs. This is a seasonal variation that happens every year. So if you directly compare the non-seasonally adjusted unemployment numbers from June with the numbers from another month (such as March) when there isn’t such a big influx of job seekers, it would look like a big increase in unemployment! 
Later in the year, unemployment typically falls as graduates find work and students return to school. This seasonal pattern makes it difficult for us to tell if a rise or fall in unemployment is a true reflection of the underlying trend or merely due to seasonal influences. To compare unemployment between different periods in the same year, we should look at the seasonally-adjusted data which remove the impact of seasonal influences.  
What do we mean by employment growth? With high employment growth, would unemployment decrease?
Employment growth refers to the additional number of persons who are in employment, derived by taking the difference in the employment level at the end of the reference period compared with the end of the preceding period. To put it simply, it is not gross job creation, but the increase in the number of people who are employed which, conceptually, is the difference between people entering and exiting employment.
While employment growth measures the additional number of persons in employment, unemployment measures the number of persons who are not in employment but are actively seeking and available for jobs.  Unemployment can vary due to changes in demand or supply of manpower.  Hence, high employment growth may not necessarily translate to lower unemployment.
Unemployment can decline if more people succeed in finding jobs or if unemployed persons stop looking for a job and leave the labour force either temporarily (e.g. to take up training) or permanently (e.g. to retire). Conversely, unemployment may rise due to an increase in jobseekers (e.g. laid off workers, fresh graduates or re-entrants to the labour market) or if more people quit their jobs to look for alternative employment.

                ","Earlier this year, there were rumours that 22 households on Pulau Ubin were facing eviction due to plans to develop the island into an adventure park. The Singapore Land Authority (SLA) has confirmed that this is not true and there were no plans to remove the residents. 
 
 
However, some rumours and misperceptions have continued spreading online. So let’s check out the facts: 
 
 
Untruth #1: The 22 households received an eviction notice in March 2013. 
 
This is not true. The 22 households received a census survey notice. SLA and HDB have clarified that the reason for this misperception was because these 22 households had received a survey notice that was wrongly captioned as a clearance scheme. 
 
The aim of the survey was really to establish the eligibility of the 22 households for resettlement benefits and NOT an eviction exercise. Those eligible for resettlement benefits will be duly paid, and can choose to remain on Pulau Ubin via a Temporary Occupation License (TOL) from SLA. 
 
 
Untruth #2: In 2009, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) approached a Pulau Ubin resident, Mr Chua Bing Qing, to evict him from the island. After discovering that the house he lives in belongs to his mother, URA later decided to charge him rent for the use of the land.
 
URA did not approach Mr Chua in 2009 to evict him from his home in Pulau Ubin.
 
Mr Chua was involved in the 2013 census survey conducted by HDB on behalf of SLA to determine his eligibility for resettlement benefits.
 
 
Untruth #3: A resident named ""Madam Samiyah"" at Kampong Chek Jawa was evicted from her house 15 years ago because the area was slated for land reclamation.
 
SLA has no records of any owner under this name whose land was affected by any land acquisition exercise in Pulau Ubin.
 
 
Untruth #4: A resident, Mr Lim Cho Tee, received numerous notices posted on his door from SLA demanding payment.
 
This is not true. Mr Lim and his family have been staying on Ubin since 1969 and they have been paying a monthly TOL promptly through Giro. The 'notices' received by Mr Lim were renewal notices for his TOL and these were not posted on his door but mailed to him.
 
SLA has said that there are no plans at this time to further develop the island, and the island will be kept in a rustic state for as long as possible for everyone to enjoy.

1.  What is the Human Organ Transplant Act?
Under the Human Organ Transplant Act (HOTA), four organs, namely the kidneys, liver, heart and corneas, can be recovered in the event of death for transplantation. The organs will give patients with organ failure another chance at life. 
All Singaporeans and Permanent Residents who turn 21 years of age and who are not mentally disordered will be covered under the Act. Those who choose to remain under HOTA will have a higher priority in receiving an organ if they need a transplant in future. 
2.  How will I be informed of the Act? 
All Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents who turn 21 years of age will receive an introductory letter from MOH informing them about HOTA and their responsibilities under the Act. They will also be informed that they can opt out if they object to donation of their organ(s) upon death. The public will also be informed of HOTA through periodic advertisements in the newspapers and on television.
3. What if I do not feel comfortable being covered under the Act? 
If you want to opt out of HOTA, you can download and complete the ""Objection to Organ Removal under Section 9(1)"" form on the Liveonwebsite or MOH's website and send it to the National Organ Transplant Unit. You can also opt out of donating specific organs.

4. What is brain death? What has brain death got to do with HOTA and organ transplant and how is brain death certified?
Under HOTA, stringent clinical criteria and steps must take place before organ recovery: the deceased must be certified brain dead before retrieval of organs can proceed. 
 
Brain death is diagnosed only when there is catastrophic irreversible brain injury. When brain death has occurred, blood flow and oxygen delivery to the brain ceases irreversibly and all brain functions are lost and will never return again.  Once diagnosed it is recognised both medically and legally as death of the person in Singapore. 
 
Brain death is determined according to strict clinical criteria. The neurological criteria for diagnosing brain death in Singapore are based on current best medical evidence and knowledge and are similar to those adopted by other countries such as USA, Australia, and UK. For organ donors, two independent doctors who are not involved in the care of the patient are required to certify brain death. Doctors accredited to certify brain death in our hospitals are specialists who have had appropriate training. 
5. When a patient is declared brain dead, how are are family members of the deceased informed about organ donation? 
After brain death has been certified, the attending doctor will meet up with the family to inform them of the patient’s medical status.  After which, the patient’s status as an organ donor would be verified against the Organ Donor Registry. If the patient has not objected to organ donation previously, in accordance to HOTA, the wishes of the patient to donate his or her organ after death must be upheld.
The hospital and healthcare team deeply empathise with the family members who have lost their loved ones.  In situations where families have expressed concerns about the donation of organs by the deceased, healthcare professionals (transplant coordinators, social workers, and medical team) would attend to their concerns, clarify any related issues that they may have, explain the legal requirements under HOTA and the process involved, as well as provide emotional support and active counselling to the family.

                Can singles only buy HDB flats from the resale market?
            ","
                    19 Feb 2018
                ","In July 2013, the SSC scheme was enhanced to allow eligible singles to buy a 2-room flat in a non-mature estate directly from HDB. What this means is that singles now have more housing options, and are not limited to buying HDB flats from the resale market. This new move also spells more good news for lower income singles in particular, as the prices have been made more attractive and affordable with the grants offered. 
More information on the SSC scheme can be found at HDBSpeaks. 
You may also have heard some misleading information and may be a little confused about the SSC scheme. Here are some facts to set the record straight! 


The amount of Additional CPF Housing Grant (AHG) and Special CPF Housing Grant (CHG) disbursed to eligible singles is tiered according to their monthly income levels. In other words, not everyone will qualify for the $30,000 grant. 
The maximum sum of $30,000 is the grant amount that singles earning up to $750 can receive from the AHG and SHG for singles. 
The $16,000 selling price (including grants) for a 2-room flat at Vine Grove @ Yishun was cited by media outlets as an example of the lowest unit offered in the July 2013 Sales launch. 
The $16,000 price tag is applicable only to applicants who register as a family nucleus or under the Joint Singles Scheme (JSS), and will qualify for the maximum AHG and SHG amount of $60,000, based on a household income of not more than $1,500. 
Singles applying under the SSC are eligible for the AHG and SHG for singles, if they meet the eligibility conditions.
The maximum grant amount (AHG+SHG) that they would be eligible for is $30,000. Using the example of the $76,000 unit at Vine Grove @ Yishun, and taking into account the additional $15,000 that singles have to pay, the lowest possible price of a 2-room flat for singles would be $61,000.
Singles can only buy 2-room BTO flats in non mature estates from HDB if they apply under the SSC or the JSS. 
Applicants looking to buy flats with their parents under the Public Scheme can purchase any flat type. Those who are orphans may also buy any flat type with their unmarried siblings under the Orphans Scheme. 
Our public housing policies remain oriented towards the family, and that is why they are heavily subsidised for families with at least two members. 
Singles will enjoy lower subsidies than families after paying an additional $15,000 on top of the purchase of the falt. However, they can apply for the CPF Top-Up Grant after marriage.

                ","Property tax is a wealth tax levied on property ownership. It is not a tax on rental income. All property owners have to pay property tax based on the value of their property, irrespective... 
1. What is Property tax?
Property tax is a wealth tax levied on property ownership. It is not a tax on rental income. It is thus levied on the ownership of properties, irrespective of whether the property is occupied or vacant.
2.How is property tax calculated? 
The property tax is calculated by multiplying the Annual Value (AV) of the property with the prevailing property tax rate. 
Annual Value (AV)
Every property has an AV. This AV of a property is determined based on market rentals of similar or comparable properties. What this means is that if you own a five-room flat in Toa Payoh, the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) looks at similar five-room flats in Toa Payoh and how much they are rented out at, to determine the Annual Value.
Property Tax rates 
We have progressive property tax rates for residential properties- the higher the value of the residential property, the higher the tax rate.
Changes were introduced to both owner-occupied homes, and non-owner occupied residential properties. 
Owner-Occupied Residential Properties 
Under the new property tax structure, properties with AV below $8,000 will pay no property tax. In fact, all homes with AVs up to $59,000 will either pay no property tax or lower effective property tax, as compared to the property tax payable under the previous structure. The new rates took effect on 1 January 2014 and 1 January 2015.
Non-Owner-Occupied Residential Properties 
(This refers to residential buildings which are not owner-occupied and does not include residential land.)
Property tax rates for non-owner-occupied residential properties will be based on a progressive scale ranging from 10% to 20%, up from a flat 10% previously. The new structure took effect from 1 January 2014.
The tax rates for owner-occupied residential rates will continue to be lower than those for non-owner-occupied residential properties. The tax rates are shown in the tables below:

3.  Why does my Annual Value change over the years?
As property tax is a wealth tax based on property ownership, AV is reviewed and adjusted to reflect the change in market values of comparable property. The AV may be revised upwards, downwards or kept at the same level depending on the market values.
4. Why do I have to pay property tax on my home when I am an owner-occupier and not deriving rental income? 
Property tax is based on property ownership and therefore is levied regardless of whether the property is owner-occupied, vacant or rented out. However, to encourage home ownership, we have a lower tax rate for owner-occupied residential properties. 
For more information on the concessionary owner-occupier's tax rate, please refer to IRAS' website.
5. I rent out my residential property and have to pay tax on my rental income and on the property. Am I being taxed twice? 
 There is no double taxation here. Property tax is imposed based on property ownership. It is different from income tax on the rental income, which is a tax on the income which an individual earns. 
For more information on property tax, please refer to IRAS' website. 
6. Why not use Capital Value to estimate Annual Value for property tax calculation? 
In Singapore, we use rental transactions of comparable properties to determine the AV of the property for the purpose of property tax, for two reasons. 
First, there are generally more rental transactions than sales transactions, to allow AV to be determined for each property based on comparable properties. Second, movements in sale prices are more volatile than rentals. Hence, using rental transactions to derive the AV helps to keep property tax more stable for property owners. 
This practice of using market rents to determine the AV is also adopted by other jurisdictions like Hong Kong and Malaysia. 
7. Why do we only have property tax as a wealth tax?
Each country has its own type of wealth taxes such as property tax, estate tax, inheritance tax and capital gains tax. The challenge is to design a wealth tax regime that is equitable, cannot be easily avoided, and does not impede economic activities.
We eliminated estate duties in 2008 as its greatest impact was not on the wealthiest individuals, who tended to manage their financial assets globally. In doing so, the Government explained that property tax would be retained as the only wealth tax as it could be structured more equitably, with the owners of more valuable properties paying more. We also do not levy wealth taxes on any other forms of wealth such as cash or equity for practical reasons - monies can easily be shifted to similar assets in other financial centres, and such taxes will impact Singapore’s competitiveness as a financial centre.
Property tax cannot be avoided or tax-planned away. It does not affect our middle and upper-middle-income group disproportionately compared to wealthier ones. It also does not impede economic activities or our competitiveness.
We have thus kept property tax as our wealth tax based on property ownership.

                How is HDB helping low-income households with a roof over their head?
            ","
                    19 Jun 2018
                ","For families who are unable to afford home ownership and have no family support, HDB offers public rental flats. The monthly household income ceiling to rent an HDB flat is $1,500. HDB is increasing the public rental stock from the current 50,000 units to 60,000 units, to assist more of such households.
The rental rates HDB charges are highly subsidised, starting from as low as $26 a month. The rates are also tiered according to household income, so that more help is extended to those in greater need.
However, some tenants may be hesitant to earn a higher income which may lead to a larger rent increase.
HDB understands these concerns.
For rental flat tenants whose monthly household income increases from “not more than $800” to “$801 to $1,500”, the HDB exercises flexibility and suspends the rental increase for one tenancy term of two years. This will ensure that they will not be made worse off after an income increase. At the end of the two years, if the income increase is still insufficient relative to the rent increase, HDB will continue to suspend the rent increase for another tenancy term of two years. This arrangement will help the tenants whose income has just increased to sustain the higher income and build up their finances.
HDB is also committed to helping rental flat tenants become home owners. If they are first-timers, they are eligible for the Special CPF Housing Grant and Additional CPF Housing Grant in their flat purchase. They may obtain up to $60,000 in grants which can help to significantly lower the loan amount required and subsequent mortgage repayments for the flat purchased.

Rumour #1: PSI index on NEA website was 393 at 10pm on 19 June but later changed to 321. 
 
This is FALSE. 
This is what MEWR says: “With reference to the queries on PSI readings posted on NEA’s website on the evening of 19 June 2013, NEA has checked its website records, which confirm that there was no PSI value posted that was higher than the 3-hour PSI reading of 321. This was the correct PSI value for 10pm on 19 June 2013. Our records also show that there had been no editing or deletion of that PSI reading on the website.”
 
Rumour #2: Tan Tock Seng Hospital overcharges the sale of N95 masks
This is FALSE.
Tan Tock Seng Hospital’s Facebook Page says: 
 “Dear Friends,
We understand the concerns of Singaporeans regarding the poor air quality. To clarify, we have not raised the price of the N95 masks. It has always been at $60 for a box of 20 pieces even before the onset of haze. We have been trying to attend to the overwhelming demand for the masks today and did not have a chance to review it. 
We will bring the price down to $50 for a box of 20 pieces of N95, starting tomorrow to make it more affordable for the public. This will be in line with the other hospital pharmacies. We will do the same for surgical masks. 
 

Rumor #3:  It has been reported on Facebook: “Yes the 9 million masks are coming into Singapore only on Monday. But none will be for the public, the entire batch will be under exclusive control by the G and all distributions of the masks will be under the tightest of scrutiny”.
 
This is FALSE.
MOH has pushed out more than 4 million masks: 1 million masks to the constituencies, through the SAF and People’s Association, and more than 3 million masks have been pushed out to the retailers.  
 
A picture says a thousand words:


 
Rumor #4: The Heart Truths alleged that Minister Vivian Balakrishnan's statement that Singapore is the only country publishing 3-hour rolling PSI, is false. 
 
The statement in The Heart Truths is false. 
 
The US, UK and Hong Kong also update their PSI hourly, using rolling 24-hour averages. We are the only country that also publishes the 3-hour PSI every hour. 
 
Rumor #5: Is it true that SARS is back in Singapore?
 
The rumour started as an outdated article from a UK newspaper (originally published in 2003) was circulated. 
 
The Ministry of Health has already clarified that there are currently no cases of SARS or MER-COV in Singapore.
  

Rumor #6: TR Emeritus claimed that PSI readings on NEA’s website do not take into account PM2.5 but are based solely on PM10
 
This is FALSE. 
 
MEWR clarifies:
PM10 refers to particulate matter smaller than 10 microns while PM2.5 refers to particulate matter smaller than 2.5 microns. Hence PM10 would also capture what is captured in the PM2.5 readings. A rise in PM2.5 levels would reflect a change in PSI. (More info on PSI levels).
 
Both 24-hr PM2.5 readings and 24-hr PSI readings are published separately in the NEA website hourly. The PM2.5 is a concentration reading which is expressed in micrograms per m3 and not a composite reading like the PSI.
 
NEA's air quality health advisories take into account both the 24-hour PSI and the 24-hour PM2.5. That's why though PSI levels on some days may be ""Moderate"", the health advisories are more cautious as they expect 24-hr PM2.5 levels to be higher, posing some risk to the susceptible groups
 
 
Rumour #7: Hailstones observed over the western part of Singapore between 1pm and 4.30pm on 25 June 2013 was caused by acid rain or cloud seeding.
 
NEA clarifies that hailstones are basically lumps of ice that form within intense thunderstorm clouds, and they are different from acid rain, which is rain that contains higher than normal amounts of nitric and sulphuric acids.
 
In fact, hailstones are quite rare in the tropics because they usually melt before reaching the ground. On average, public sightings of hailstones in Singapore occur every one to two years. (More information on hail can be found on NEA's website.)
 
The Meteorological Service Singapore confirmed that the hail experienced in Singapore on 25 June 2013 was not caused by the cloud seeding in Indonesia as rain clouds formed by such seeding cannot travel such long distances to reach Singapore. 
 
Rumour #8: The Government is profiteering from the sale of N95 masks. 
MOH clarifies that to date, a total of 4.15 million N95 masks have been released from MOH's stockpile: 3.15 million to retailers and 1 million to the People's Association for distribution to low-income families. The cost of the masks, including transport and storage, is recovered from retailers. 
MOH is working with manufacturers and suppliers to ensure the supply of N95 masks in Singapore, including replenishing MOH's stockpile.

                    19 Feb 2018
                ","What is the licensing framework for online news sites all about? 
News websites which report regularly on Singapore and have a significant reach will be individually licensed. Currently all traditional news providers are individually licensed under the Broadcasting Act (TV broadcasters) and the Newspaper and Printing Presses Act (newspapers) respectively. Licensing news providers on an individual basis helps to ensure that they are responsible and accountable for the content they put out, be it on television, print or online.  
So why introduce the new framework and what is the difference?
Governments around the world are thinking about how to deal with the regulatory challenges posed by changes to the media landscape. Technological advances have blurred the distinctions between traditional forms of media such as print, film and broadcast. But what has not changed is the role of news providers, and the public’s expectation that they report responsibly instead of operating contrary to the public interest. This concern is often addressed through some form of regulation or oversight. Changes in how news providers operate have necessitated discussions on how best to update these regulatory frameworks. The United Kingdom and New Zealand are examples of countries where such discussions are taking place. But each country’s situation is unique, and the solutions considered and adopted are thus different. 
In Singapore, we are updating our regulatory framework in recognition of the changes to the media landscape. The new framework will bring greater parity to how we regulate news providers across different forms of media.
Internet content providers in Singapore are already automatically class-licensed under the Broadcasting Act. Class licensees are required to comply with the Class Licence conditions and the Internet Code of Practice, which are guidelines about what our community regards as offensive or harmful.  Content should not “go against public interest, public order, national harmony, and/or offends against good taste or decency”.  For instance, pornographic content, extremist messages and racially or religiously-insensitive content should not be put up on the Internet. So with this class licence already in place, there is a baseline standard of responsibility for what we publish online. 
Since the Class Licence was introduced in 1996, MDA has asked websites to remove content that was in breach of content guidelines only 24 times. Only one instance was for content that was religiously-insensitive, and most other instances had to do with pornographic material or advertisements soliciting sex. There has not been an instance where MDA has directed sites to take down content that is critical of the Government or any Minister. 
Under the new framework, online news sites will no longer be class licensed, but will be licensed on an individual basis. This helps to ensure that they are responsible for the content they provide to the public. But the Internet Code of Practice and content standards have not changed. You can find out more about the Internet Code of Practice here: http://www.mda.gov.sg/Documents/PDF/licences/mobj.981.Internet_Code_of_Practice.pdf

Who are affected by the new framework and what must they do to comply?
With the Media Development Authority’s (MDA) new licensing framework, online news sites will be shifted from the class licence to an individual licence, if they:
Personal blogs by their nature do not consistently provide “news, intelligence, report of occurrence, or any matter of public interest”. Hence, MDA has explained that personal blogs will not be affected so long as they do not morph into news sites. 
MDA has identified the following 10 sites as having met the criteria and will be working closely with the providers of these websites to bring them under the new licensing framework:
Licensed sites will need to:

For the lower 20 percent of Singaporeans, income growth was weak or negative in 2002-2007, and only recovered in the last five years (2007-2012). 
Individual wages 
The median worker saw real wage growth of 9.3% in 2007-2012. However, in the previous five years from 2002 to 2007, real wages of the median worker declined by 0.2% [Chart 1].
Real wages of the worker at the 20th percentile grew more slowly at 4.4% in 2007-2012, offsetting a fall by 3.7% from 2002 to 2007.
Note that the figures for real income growth are after deducting ‘All-Items CPI’ inflation. This includes costs of imputed rentals on owner-occupied homes, which are not actual cash expenditures. Real income growth in the last five years was stronger when excluding this item – at 8.2% and 13.2% respectively for the 20th percentile and median income worker in 2007-2012 (see footnote to Chart 1).

Household income
Similarly, real median monthly household income from work on a per household member basis has increased by 13.9% in the last five years (2007-2012), after growing by 7.9% in the previous five years (2002-2007) [Chart 2].
Real income growth at the 20th percentile was also stronger in the second half of the decade (10.2%) than the first half (4.4%). 
Real income growth in the last five years was stronger when excluding imputed rentals on owner-occupied homes  – at 19.2% and 18.8% respectively for the 20th percentile and median income household in 2007-2012 (see footnote to Chart 2).

International comparisons of real income growth
Slowing or stagnating incomes are a challenge for most developed countries, and the more developed ones in Asia. Chart 3 compares real income growth in Singapore with that in similar Asian economies.

Capacity in our rail and bus network will grow over the next five years. Between now and 2017, the Downtown Line will open in phases and this will significantly increase capacity to the east-west corridor. Completed re-signalling work for the existing North-South and East-West Lines will increase peak hour capacity by 20%. The delivery of new trains will also add about 70% more total capacity to the northeast corridor, and 60% more capacity to the Circle Line by 2015.
During off-peak hours and weekends, commuters can expect trains to arrive more frequently. Waiting times for trains will not exceed five minutes except for very early morning and very late night train services. This is targeted to roll out for the North-South and East-West Lines this year, and will extend to the other MRT lines by around 2015.
Bus Service Enhancement Programme

Since the launch of the Bus Service Enhancement Programme (BSEP) in September 2012, about 90 buses have been added, with five new bus routes and improvements to 50 existing bus services as well. This year, another 190 buses will join those already on the road, which means that half of the 550 buses promised under the five-year programme will be in service by the end of this year. This will allow the Government to roll out more new routes, and improve more bus services across the island, resulting in tangible improvements through shorter waiting times, less crowding, and better connectivity for commuters.
3. Improving Service Reliability
Bus Reliability and Priority Measures

The Government will also work with bus operators to improve the reliability of their buses on the road, so that commuters experience more regular waiting times. Over the next two years, $50 million to improve bus speeds through measures such as adding about 30 kilometres of bus lanes, increasing the Mandatory Give-Way to Buses scheme by another 150 bus stops, and quadrupling the number of bus hubs from 10 to 40 so that more buses can pick up passengers at the same time. 
 
Train Reliability
Train reliability will also be improved. By upgrading trains and preventive maintenance, the Government aims to work with operators to halve the train withdrawal rate, from one withdrawal per 1,000 trips to one withdrawal per 2,000 trips.
4.   Managing Travel Demand 
To manage peak hour travel demand into the city area, the Government will offer free pre-peak travel on the MRT to shift travel behaviour and reduce crowding on trains during morning peak hours. Starting 24 June 2013, commuters who end their journey before 7.45am on weekdays at 16 designated MRT stations in the city area will travel free. Commuters who exit at these stations between 7.45am and 8:00am will be given a discount of up to 50 cents off their train fare. The Government will be funding this one-year trial.  This will replace the current scheme where commuters who travel off-peak save up to 50 cents off their rail fare if they exit at 14 designated MRT stations in the city centre before 7:45am.
Commuters travelling outside the city centre are not left out. The “Incentives for Singapore’s Commuters” (INSINC) allows commuters to accumulate points for rewards of up to $200, when they travel islandwide at all MRT stations. Commuters will be rewarded with more points for travelling during the morning decongesting hours (6:30am – 7:30am; 8:30am – 9:30am).
The effect of these schemes is expected to continue to grow, as commuters take time to make arrangements to adjust their travel behaviour.  In the meantime, the Government is also working with major employers and institutions to inject more flexibility in their working hours and encourage them to implement the necessary workplace practices to facilitate their employees to travel off-peak.

                ","Certificate Of Entitlement (COE) prices are determined by demand and supply, and can change at each bidding exercise. 
Many things can affect demand, including how well the economy is doing, the launch of new vehicle models, competition between vehicle manufacturers, and others. The supply of COEs is influenced by the current vehicle growth rate and the number of COEs released from vehicles which have been de-registered. COEs released through de-registration usually form the bulk of the 'new' COE supply.
The COE system helps prevent our roads from being gridlocked by setting a quota on the number of new vehicles to be registered in Singapore each year.  Once the COE quota is fixed, the COE price is determined by market forces, matching demand to the supply available. The lower the demand, the lower the COE price and vice versa. If the Government intervenes to manage the price of COEs we would have to release more COEs if COE prices rise significantly. This will lead to an unsustainable vehicle growth and more congested roads due to more vehicles. 
Unlike housing, health or education, car ownership cannot be treated as a basic necessity in land-scarce Singapore. The COE system is not perfect, but it remains the most appropriate way for us to manage our private vehicle numbers. To help all Singaporeans continue to enjoy a high degree of mobility, we are building up our public transport systems with more rail lines and more buses, and also working on improving the reliability of services. We will also continue to encourage premium bus services and improve our taxi system to help bridge the gap between private and mass public transport.

Applicants wishing to purchase a subsidised flat directly from HDB must have at least one Singapore Citizen listed as a flat buyer in their application. This is to ensure fair opportunity for the Singapore Citizen applicant to enjoy subsidised public housing.
SC-SPR applicants, however, do not get to enjoy the same level of benefits as SC-SC applicants. They have to pay a premium of $10,000, on top of the purchase price, when buying a flat directly from HDB. This amount will only be reimbursed when the SPR spouse takes up citizenship, or when they have a Singapore Citizen child.
SPR-SPR households, on the other hand, do not enjoy the privilege of buying subsidised new flats at all. They can only purchase resale flats from the secondary market at prevailing market prices, and they do not enjoy any form of housing subsidies from the Government. 
HDB's housing policies are formulated to prioritise Singaporeans first, and do not benefit SPRs over Singapore Citizens in any way. You may refer to this infographic to find out more about the differences in benefits for Singapore Citizen and SPR households.

                ","We often hear that foreign workers in Singapore compete with Singaporeans for high-paying professional, managerial and executive (or PME) positions.  The government is considering measures to ensure that Singaporeans are treated fairly when it comes to PME jobs and it will reduce the inflow of both S-Pass and EP holding foreigners. In the meantime, it is important to realise that the overwhelming majority of non-resident foreigners in Singapore are here to do jobs that Singaporeans do not want to do.
There are many different types of foreign workers in Singapore. According to population figures from June 2012, work permit holders make up the largest group of foreigners working in Singapore at 46%, followed by dependents of Singapore citizens/PRs/work pass holders (15%), and foreign domestic workers (13%). Employment Pass and S Pass holders make up the smallest groups at about 12% and 9% of the non-resident population respectively.  
While Employment Pass and S Pass holders are usually educated, meet a specific salary criterion, and hold PMET (professionals, managers, executives and technicians) positions, work permit holders usually refers to semi-skilled/unskilled foreign workers that come here to take up jobs that Singaporeans might not wish to do. This helps alleviate labour shortage problems in some industries. 
This essentially means that majority of non-resident foreign workers in Singaporeans are not here to compete with Singaporeans for high-paying professional or managerial jobs. Rather they are here to help build our homes, keep our roads clean, and make our lives just a little more comfortable.

            ","
                    19 Feb 2018
                ","Executive Condominiums are not HDB flats. They are sold with certain restrictions so that they are available at affordable prices within the reach of middle-income Singapore families who have aspirations of owning private housing, as ECs become private property after 10 years.   
Prospective EC buyers are subject to initial eligibility and ownership restrictions, which are similar to those imposed on buyers of subsidised HDB flats. For instance, only a Singapore citizen family nucleus is entitled to purchase an EC, and buyers have to meet a five-year minimum occupation period before they are allowed to sell or rent out the EC. 
Recent news reports have highlighted a penthouse unit at Heron Bay EC and the presidential unit at CityLife @ Tampines, which were sold at $1.77 million and $2.05 million respectively. The prices and sizes of these exceptional units elicited responses from many, who cast doubts on the affordability of EC units, as well as the types of units being offered in recent EC projects. 
To address such excesses, the Ministry of National Development recently introduced new measures, so that the EC scheme can continue to remain relevant to Singaporean families. These include:
a) The maximum strata floor area of new EC units will be capped at 160 square metres. 
b) Sales of new dual-key EC units will be restricted to multi-generational families only. 
c) Private enclosed spaces and private roof terraces will be treated as gross floor area (GFA). The GFA of such spaces in non-landed residential developments, including ECs, will be counted as part of the ‘bonus’ GFA of a residential development and subject to payment of charges. This is in line with the treatment of balconies under URA’s current guidelines. Details of this measure are at www.ura.gov.sg/circulars/text/dc13-01.htm. 
d) Developers of future EC sale sites from the Government Land Sales programme will only be allowed to launch units for sale 15 months from the date of award of the sites or after the physical completion of foundation works, whichever is earlier.
These measures should help to ensure that ECs remain a viable option for middle-class Singaporean households. 
For its part, HDB is committed to providing sufficient new flat supply in 2013 to meet demand. HDB will launch at least 23,000 flats, instead of 20,000 as originally planned, across various housing estates in Singapore. The projected supply, along with planned EC launches, will offer prospective flat buyers more choices across a range of different budgets.

                Will the Marina Barrage cause flooding in Orchard Road?
            ","
                    19 Feb 2018
                ","Some have speculated that the Marina Barrage might have caused the recent increase in flooding episodes in Singapore.  Could it be that during a torrential downpour, the excess storm water could not be discharged into the sea fast enough because of the Barrage, and therefore caused a back up of storm water flow, which resulted in the floods at the upstream areas like Orchard Road?  
The Stamford Canal (about 4.7km in length) starts from the junction of Tanglin Road and Grange Road, through Orchard Road, and drains into Marina Reservoir. The upper reaches of the Stamford Canal like the Cuscaden Road/Orchard Road junction are on elevated grounds which are at least 5m above the mean operating water level of Marina Reservoir. 
The flooding incidents on 16 June 2010 and 5 June 2011 took place at Orchard Road and Tanglin/Cuscaden Road areas respectively.  As the influence of the Marina Barrage cannot reach up to the elevated grounds at Orchard Road and Tanglin/Cuscaden Road (both of which are located too high and too far from the Barrage), the operations of the Marina Barrage did not contribute to the flooding there. 
This fact was affirmed by the Expert Panel on Drainage Design and Flood Protection Measures, which had independently reviewed flood protection and risk management measures that will be implemented in Singapore over the next decade (full report released in Jan 2012). Simulations of various scenarios based on actual rainfall events during those flooding incidents in June 2010 and June 2011 showed that flooding would have occurred with or without the Marina Barrage. The panel also concluded that the flood occurred due to the fact that Stamford Canal was not able to cope with the volume of rainfall on these two days. In reviewing rainfall records over the last 30 years, the panel had found that there is a trend towards higher rainfall intensities and an increased frequency of intense rains. 
So does the Marina Barrage ease flooding? 
The Marina Barrage’s flood control function helps to protect low-lying areas in the city from the influence of sea tides by controlling the water level in the Marina Reservoir.  Before the Barrage was built, low-lying areas like Chinatown, Boat Quay, Jalan Besar and Geylang were sometimes flooded during extreme high tides, even when there was no rain. 
How the Marina Barrage works
            
The Marina Barrage has a system of nine crest gates and seven drainage pumps.
When it rains heavily during low tide (i.e., sea water level is lower than the water level in the Marina Reservoir), the crest gates are sequentially opened to release excess storm water into the sea.
When it rains heavily during high tide (i.e., sea water level is higher than the water level in the Marina Reservoir), the seven drainage pumps, each capable of emptying an Olympic-size swimming pool in 60 seconds, will drain excess storm water into the sea instead, and therefore lower the water level in the Marina Reservoir. 
The infographic below illustrates how the Marina Barrage helps in flood control.

What is the Government doing to protect the Orchard Road during heavy downpours?

To further strengthen the flood protection for the Orchard Road area which is served by the Stamford Canal, PUB is constructing a detention tank and diversion canal at the upstream section of the Stamford Canal catchment area. The new diversion canal will divert stormwater from one-third of the catchment towards the Singapore River. This allows the existing Stamford Canal to serve a smaller catchment size, enabling it to better protect the catchment against heavier rains. Complementing the diversion canal is a detention tank which will be built to capture excess stormwater from the existing drains along Holland Road. Works for the detention tank are expected to complete by end 2015, while the diversion canal will be ready by end 2017.

Inflation is measured by the increase in the Consumer Price index (CPI). The CPI basket consists of more than 6,500 brands/varieties of goods and services commonly purchased by resident households. 
Some of the components of CPI are affected by the cost of imported goods (e.g. food), while some are affected by domestic cost pressures. 
The government keeps a close watch on consumer price developments from both imported and domestic inflation, and undertakes several measures to mitigate them.  
Measures to mitigate imported inflation
The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has allowed the Singapore dollar to appreciate so as to help mitigate higher prices of imports such as food and oil. 
To keep the costs of prepared food affordable, the National Environment Agency (NEA) intends to adopt management models that can help keep costs low.  For example, NTUC Foodfare, a social cooperative, was appointed to run the new Bukit Panjang Hawker Centre on a not-for-profit basis.  In addition, NEA plans to add 10 more hawker centres across Singapore to provide affordable food options to Singaporeans.  
In addition, the Retail Price Watch Group (RPWG), headed by Senior Minister of State for Trade & Industry and National Development, Mr Lee Yi Shyan, keeps a close watch on any excessive price increases of food and other daily necessities. For non-prepared food, the RPWG has worked with supermarkets, wholesalers, hawkers, and food courts to promote the availability of cheaper alternatives.  The RPWG’s supermarket members – NTUC FairPrice, Giant and Sheng Siong – have for various periods held constant the low prices of their housebrand products to help consumers cope with rising costs.
Measures to mitigate domestic cost pressures

While housing prices are not part of CPI inflation, they are of concern to young families, especially those that do not yet own their homes. The Ministry of National Development has taken significant steps to boost the supply of Build-to-Order (BTO) HDB flats and private residential property. The subsidies for HDB flats are also regularly reviewed to ensure that public housing are affordable, especially for first-time buyers. The government has also implemented a number of demand management measures, and will continue to monitor the housing market closely.
To manage the possible impact of a tight labour market, the government works with unions and companies to raise productivity. This can be achieved through improving the production processes of companies, as well as encouraging workers to upgrade their skill sets. With enhanced productivity, firms will be able to pay their workers better salaries and cope with higher business costs, without the need to pass on the increased costs to consumers. 
At the individual household level, the government also provides assistance to help mitigate the impact of rising costs on households.  For example, under the permanent GST Voucher Scheme, U-Save rebates are provided every quarter to help HDB households directly offset their utilities bills. Although these grants do not reduce CPI inflation, they help to cushion the impact of the rising cost of living experienced by households.
The government will continue to keep a close watch on inflation, and is prepared to introduce additional measures if necessary.

Middle- to higher-skilled foreign labour in the PMET workforce complements Singaporean workers by bringing along relevant skills to create new industries and job opportunities. Skilled foreign manpower helps to fill the labour gap and facilitate the transfer of skills to locals. This allows us to anchor new industries such as biomedical sciences, digital media animation and aerospace. Equipped with the appropriate skills and expertise, over time, locals will be able to take on the good jobs created within these industries. As of June 2012, they constitute about 21% of the non-resident population in Singapore. Majority of the non-resident population (59%) are work permit holders and foreign domestic workers.

When bringing in foreign manpower, we take into consideration each sector’s manpower needs, the skill sets of our local workforce to fill those jobs and the types of foreign workers needed to complement locals. Measures in place, such as levies and quotas help manage the inflow of foreign workers. For higher skilled foreigners, they must meet the required salary and qualifications level in order to qualify for an Employment Pass (EP) to work in Singapore. This will ensure that foreigners who come to Singapore will ultimately contribute to the creation of new industries and opportunities for Singaporeans.

Singapore is a key hub for many businesses serving the Asia markets. They may consider moving out of Singapore if manpower needs are not met. As businesses scale back, job opportunities for Singaporeans will be limited. With less attractive job opportunities in Singapore, more highly-skilled Singaporeans will start to seek opportunities elsewhere. This may cause a vicious cycle, further shrinking the size of the workforce. 
As the economy stagnates, it will be difficult to garner fiscal resources to invest in physical infrastructure for instance, or to address the needs of lower-income Singaporeans. Without economic growth, social and welfare programmes can quickly become unsustainable. 
Besides just getting older and smaller, our citizen population is also growing increasingly educated. We will need to decide how to meet the challenges of our demographic changes and its impact on economic growth. This will allow us to calibrate our policies so that we can continue to create good job opportunities for Singaporeans in the long run.

Law & Government,MDA's classification decision on Sex.Violence.FamilyValues,/factually/content/mdas-classification-decision-on-sexviolencefamilyvalues,"
                MDA&#39;s classification decision on Sex.Violence.FamilyValues
            ","
                    19 Feb 2018
                ","When the short film Porn Masala was submitted to MDA for classification in December 2011, it was assigned an M18 rating because MDA...
1)      Why did MDA revoke the film Sex.Violence.FamilyValues’ original M18 rating?
 
When the short film Porn Masala was submitted to MDA for classification in December 2011, it was assigned an M18 rating because MDA recognised it as a satire on racial ignorance and stereotyping. The rating was accompanied by a consumer advice for coarse language and racial stereotyping, to enable the viewing public to make an informed choice. 
 
In August 2012, Sex.Violence.FamilyValues, a compendium comprising Cartoons, Porn Masala and The Bouncer was submitted for classification. The compendium received an M18 rating. 
 
However, in late September 2012, MDA received complaints specific to scenes in Porn Masala from members of the public. One set of complaints related to the racist language used by one character, and another set of complaints concerned a character dressed in a school uniform from a local school. The complaints appeared to have been triggered by an online film trailer released by the producers on the film’s official website ahead of the film’s intended premiere in October 2012. 
 
In classifying films, MDA seeks to reflect prevailing community standards. This means that it does not attempt to push the boundaries beyond what the community is prepared to accept, nor does it seek to defend the status quo when the community has moved past it. In this case, considering the strength of the feedback received, MDA decided to review Porn Masala through a consultation with the Films Consultative Panel (FCP). Of the members who reviewed the film in its entirety, an overwhelming 20 out of 24 felt that while the film may be a satire, the specific comments were offensive and demeaning to Indians to the extent that it should not be given a rating. The rest felt that the film can be allowed under a R21 rating. The FCP did not take exception to the depiction of a character attired in a school uniform. 
 
In practice, the FCP has not, after reviewing cases referred to it, reached fundamentally different conclusions from MDA. By the same token, it would be wrong for MDA to ignore the FCP in this rare instance where an overwhelming majority disagreed with MDA’s classification. Thus, MDA took the Panel’s recommendation, and informed director Ken Kwek of the Not Allowed for All Ratings (NAR) decision on Porn Masala on 8 October 2012, two days after he was informed of MDA's review. 
  
2)      Who are the members sitting on the Films Consultative Panel, and in what cases does MDA consult the Panel on the classification of films?
 
The FCP comprises volunteers of various professions, age groups, religions and races, broadly representative of Singapore’s demographics. 
 
Given the volume of films received for classification, it is impractical to expect the FCP to review every film. MDA thus consults the FCP in two situations. Firstly, if in the course of classifying a film, it assesses that the content is potentially contentious and insights into community sentiments would be helpful to arriving at an appropriate classification. Secondly, if, having classified a film, it receives complaints about the appropriateness of its classification.
3)      Following an appeal by the film director and producer to the Films Appeal Committee, what was the Committee’s decision?
 
Under the Films Act, film owners may appeal against MDA’s classification to the Films Appeal Committee (FAC). An appeal was lodged by Sex.Violence.FamilyValues director Ken Kwek and producer Tay Eu-Yen. 
Having considered the grounds for the appeal, the producers' representations, as well as views from MDA's advisory panels and interested members of the public, the Films Appeal Committee has decided that Sex.Violence.FamilyValues may be allowed for exhibition under a Restricted 21 (or R21) classification with edits. 
In arriving at its decision, the FAC took into account public complaints arising from an online trailer containing the more controversial segments of the film, especially with regard to racial references in Porn Masala, one of three short films comprising Sex.Violence.FamilyValues. 
The FAC also considered the MDA's Film Classification Guidelines, which state that films ""that denigrate any racial or religious group, or create misunderstanding or disharmony amongst the races are not allowed for all ratings"". In the case of Sex.Violence.FamilyValues, the FAC is of the view that while it does not condone or promote racism, some of the racial references employed in the film are indeed offensive to the Indian community. Therefore, the film may be exhibited under an R21 classification if these offensive references are edited.

                ","This is done by controlling public transport fares through a price cap formula. The formula requires the PTOs to share productivity savings with commuters, and hence results in lower fare increases. The system safeguards the interests of commuters and ensures that fares are kept affordable. 
In fact, public transport fares have only increased marginally in the past years. As a share of household spending, the average household has been spending significantly less on public transport fares - 3.6% in 2011, compared to 5.0% in 2005, indicating that our public transport fares continue to remain very affordable for the general public (click here). 
Some have argued that nationalising our public transport system will translate to lower public transport fares. In terms of public transport affordability, Singapore’s fares are actually more affordable than fares in other cities like London, New York and Tokyo, which have nationalised parts of their public transport systems (click here).

                ","Measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) are common childhood diseases that can lead to serious complications in children, including death. MMR vaccination is the most effective way to prevent these diseases, which can spread easily from an infected person to another. 
The rumour that the MMR vaccine causes autism, arose from the publication of a study* in the Lancet medical journal published in 1998. However, the findings of the study have since been discredited as it was found that some data had been falsified. Indeed, other large-scale scientific studies have been conducted and these have found no evidence of any links between the use of the vaccine and autism. 
Hence, health authorities around the world, including the World Health Organisation, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Expert Committee on Immunisation of Singapore continue to recommend that children receive the MMR vaccine. The MMR vaccination is offered at polyclinics, private general practitioner clinics and paediatric clinics.


*The study has since been retracted.

                    19 Feb 2018
                ","Some recent online articles highlighted the fact that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had in April 2012 restated Singapore’s fiscal data in the IMF’s World Economic Outlook (WEO) database. The restatement increased the figure for the cumulative government surplus for the period 1990-2011 from $271bn as reported in the WEO database in September 2011 to $429bn in April 2012.
This was a major restatement in the WEO database. However, there was also online speculation that the restatement was due to the IMF discovering discrepancies in Singapore’s fiscal data, and that we had been under-reporting our government revenues and surpluses.
This is untrue. The restatement of data in the WEO database was due to technical errors in the course of an IMF data migration exercise. It had nothing to do with the data reported by Singapore. The IMF corrected the errors in August 2012 when it reported a cumulated government surplus of $267bn for the period. The IMF has explained its restatement of Singapore’s historical fiscal data in the WEO database.
We should highlight too that the IMF’s data on Singapore Government surpluses follows the IMF’s regular presentation format, which includes revenues that are not fully available for spending by the Singapore Government, such as land sales proceeds and investment income. The data reported in Singapore’s Government Budget only includes revenues that are available for spending, under the Singapore’s Constitution. (Further details can be found here.)

The Government does not publish the size of assets managed by GIC, although the asset size of MAS and Temasek are published. On the basis of the information that the Government has published, as well as the full system of checks and balances, these recent claims are baseless. Indeed, they are fantastical, but let’s look at some basic facts.
For more information, watch this  
Our reserves are managed by three agencies – the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC), Temasek Holdings (Temasek) and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). The Government’s assets, other than its deposits with MAS and its stake in Temasek, are mainly managed by the GIC. The MAS which is a statutory board, manages its own assets. Temasek, which is wholly owned by the Government, also manages its own assets.
For more information on our reserves, watch this video.
 
However this does not mean that GIC is unaccountable, or that there are no checks in place. (See item 4.) 
 
 
Furthermore, like other value-oriented investors, Temasek takes concentrated position in a selected portfolio of companies that it considers to be able to deliver value. In addition, unlike the stock market indices which comprise listed equities, Temasek’s portfolio includes unlisted investments. This is similar to that of private equity firms, which make returns from IPOs, mergers and cash distributions to shareholders from their portfolio of companies.  It is not uncommon for good private equity firms to deliver returns that have significantly outperformed the market indices over the long run. 
 
Our reserves cannot ‘go missing’ (see item 4). 

Some of the confusion created by these recent “estimates” of GIC’s assets arises from the following errors:

First, they assume that all the Government’s available funds are flowed to GIC alone. The Government has significant deposits placed in MAS. As of 31 March 2012, the Government has $147 billion deposited with MAS, compared to MAS’ Official Foreign Reserves (OFR) valued at S$305 billion. MAS has a significant proportion of its portfolio invested in liquid financial market instruments and hence earns a lower rate of return than GIC. 

Second, debt servicing costs are sometimes ignored in these estimates. This results in an over-estimate of the assets accumulated through investing the proceeds from the issuance of Government securities, especially over long periods of time. For more information on the Government’s debt position, please refer to the MOF website.

Third, they overestimate the funds flow into GIC by including the interest and dividend income that the Government gets on its investments. These estimates incorrectly assume the full amount of government budget surpluses as fresh fund injections, without first removing the interest and dividend income portion.
 
Singapore has no net debt. Its large gross debt position is due to the issuance of government securities. However, the Government’s assets substantially exceed these debts. 

This can be seen from the fact that the Government has significant net investment returns that can be spent on the Budget each year. Under the Constitution, the Government is able to spend from the Net Investment Returns only if it enjoys a positive net asset position. In other words, if the Government’s assets fall short of its liabilities, there can be no contribution from the investment returns on reserves in the Government Budget. 

After deducting all the Government’s liabilities (including CPF monies), the remaining net assets produce significant returns. The Net Investment Returns Contribution (NIRC) is about $7 billion; it should be further noted that the NIRC only comprises up to 50% of the returns earned on the reserves. 

The Government’s strong net asset position also illustrates why CPF monies are safe. To underscore this, the Government fully guarantees the bonds that CPF monies are invested in. 
 
Singapore has a unique system.  We do not borrow to fund the Government Budget, as the Constitution as well as the Government Securities Act prevents us from doing so. Furthermore, the Government is required to run a balanced budget over every term of government, which is about 4 to 5 years. Government debt issuances are therefore invested and not spent on the Budget.

The two types of Government debt securities are issued for reasons unrelated to the Government’s fiscal needs: 

a) Singapore Government Securities (SGS) are marketable debt instruments issued for purposes of developing Singapore's debt markets. The principal objectives of SGS issuance are to: i) build a liquid SGS market to provide a risk-free benchmark against which other private debt securities are priced off; ii) foster the growth of an active secondary market both for cash transactions and derivatives, to enable efficient risk management; and iii) encourage issuers and investors, both domestic and international, to participate in the Singapore bond market. As at December 2011, SGS stock is valued at S$79 billion, while the stock of Treasury-Bills is valued at S$59 billion.


The issuance of Government debt is solely for the above two purposes. As explained in item 5 and in Q11 on MOF’s website, the proceeds from the issuance of debt cannot be used to improve the investment performance of GIC or Temasek. 

For more information on government debt, please refer to the annual government debt report or our Factually article on CPF.

 
[1] Total Shareholder Return measures compounded annual returns to shareholder as if it held the Temasek portfolio directly. It accounts for the appreciation of the value of assets, includes dividends to shareholder and excludes capital injections from shareholder.
[2] In its annual report for 2011/2012, GIC reported 5, 10 and 20-year annualised nominal returns in USD terms of 3.4%, 7.6% and 6.8% respectively. It also reported a 20-year real rate of return of 3.9%. GIC also publishes the performance data of two composite portfolios to put its investment returns into perspective. These portfolios comprise of 60% global equities and 40% global bonds, and 70% global equities and 30% global bonds. For the 5- and 10-year periods, GIC reported higher returns with lower risk than both composite portfolios. For the 20-year period, GIC had lower returns and lower risk. This was because its portfolio was more conservatively invested with more cash and bonds in the first decade of the 20-year period.

                ","Some may be under the misconception that the Media Development Authority (MDA) still has its ‘scissor hands’ on, but MDA has in fact moved away from censorship towards classification and co-regulation. This is to ensure that diverse audiences have greater access to a wide range of media choices without compromising on the need to protect young children from undesirable content. 
 
Central to MDA’s classification framework is the use of ratings to help consumers make more informed media choices. Ratings for films, broadcast programmes and arts entertainment are accompanied by consumer advice so that audiences can make an informed choice about what media content they wish to view or listen to. As for publications, magazines with mature content are shrinkwrapped with consumer advice to signal that such content is not suitable for the young. 
 
Content regulation has evolved to become a three-way partnership. MDA works with its citizen-based consultative committees and the industry to establish content guidelines for films, broadcast, arts entertainment, publications and the Internet based on community values, while educating the public on content regulation and how to make informed choices for themselves and their children. Feedback from the public is also taken in consideration.
Some classification decisions have attracted more public feedback than others, such as in the case of the film Les Misérables.


Why are there two classification ratings for Les Misérables?  
In classifying a film, MDA considers elements such as sex, nudity, language, violence and horror, as well as the theme, content, context and overall impact of the film.  The first version of Les Misérables that was submitted to MDA for classification contained two sexual scenes, one of which showed a prostitute having sex with her client.  The film was therefore rated NC16, with consumer advice for sexual scenes and some violence.  The film distributor accepted the NC16 rating as it was still able to reach out to its target audiences.
For commercial reasons, the film distributor decided to bring in an edited version of Les Misérables under the Dual Rating Policy. The distributor had one sexual scene edited so that the film could be viewed by younger audiences.  MDA classified this edited version PG13 with consumer advice for sexual references and violence.  This PG13 version was released in local cinemas in mid-February 2013. 
 
MDA has allowed dual ratings since 2003 so that film distributors can screen two versions of the same movie to reach out to wider audiences.  A recent example is local film Imperfect, starring veteran actor Li Nanxing.  The film was initially released with an NC16 rating due to its violent gang-fight scenes.  The distributor also released a PG13 version for younger audiences after editing some violent scenes.

                    19 Jun 2018
                ","There have been concerns expressed by some that the high selling prices of some SBF flats during the September 2012 sales exercise indicate that public housing in Singapore is no longer affordable.  
But these prices are an exception. They do not represent the general price trend of new Build-To-Order (BTO) and SBF flats that HDB offers on a regular basis. These particular units feature highly desirable attributes and therefore command a premium, catering only to select buyers.  They also form a very small proportion of the flat types and total number of flats on offer. For example, a 3-room unit offered at Jalan Bahagia is in fact a landed 2-storey terrace house with two bedrooms and a built up area of 106 square metres, which is equivalent to the size of a current 5-room HDB flat. It is therefore not a typical HDB flat. 
If you look at the flats offered in the September sales exercise, the majority are below the $600,000 price tag. In fact, there are 4-room SBF flats that start from as low as $208,000, inclusive of the grants that first-timer households can enjoy. 
HDB’s commitment is that new public housing will remain within the reach of most working Singaporean families, particularly first-timer households. HDB offers a wide variety of flats, differing by type, floor height, or location, so that buyers would be able to find an option within their means. 
Among other measures, HDB is introducing greater flat supply for prospective flat buyers. In addition to the 25,000 flats that HDB had committed to build this year, we will be offering an additional 2,000 flats. This will bring the total BTO supply in 2012 to 27,000 units. Inclusive of flats offered under the SBF exercises, the total supply is about 34,000 units this year.
HDB would like to highlight that we have consistently recorded a deficit for our Home Ownership Programme over the years. Yearly statements of accounts are available for review in our Annual Reports.

You may have read recent reports about some resale HDB flats being sold at more than $900,000, along with concerns expressed by some that high Cash-Over-Valuation (COV) levels were pushing resale prices beyond the reach of many Singaporeans.
Such high resale prices are the exception rather than the norm. The overall Resale Price Index has shown signs of stabilising. The resale transactions highlighted in the media involved selected flats with highly desirable attributes, including the flat type, location, view, and internal decorations, which some buyers consider to be worth a premium price.
Resale flat prices are negotiated between willing buyers and sellers in the open market. Sellers will want to sell their flats at the highest price possible. Buyers should take a look at the transacted prices in the vicinity, consider the options available, and negotiate for a price that they can afford comfortably.
While HDB is not directly involved in the price negotiation process for resale flats, we help buyers make informed decisions by publishing up-to-date information on prices, as well as financing options on the HDB InfoWEB.
Prices in the public housing market have risen over the past few years, due to a strong economy, low interest rates, and high liquidity. Alongside the Government’s cooling measures, HDB has ramped up its building programme, offering more than 50,000 new flats in 2011 and 2012. HDB will keep up the pace in 2013 and offer another 25,000 new flats this year.
HDB has also stabilised prices of new BTO flats by de-linking them from the resale market. This means that new flats are priced considerably lower than comparable resale flats, keeping BTO prices steady even as resale prices go up. These new flats cover a diverse range of flat types (from 2-room flats to 5-room flats) in various estates catering to families with different budgets.
In addition, various subsidies, grants and priority schemes are also available to first-timer Singapore citizen families to help them set up their homes. HDB remains committed to keeping public housing affordable and accessible for Singaporean families.

                ","Are HDB flats today smaller than what they used to be? Have they continued to shrink year by year? Some have said that HDB has not been upfront about the shrinking of flat sizes over the years. So what exactly are the facts? 
The short answer is that the typical HDB flat today is indeed smaller in size than what it was 20 or 30 years ago. However, it has remained constant in size for the last 15 years, since 1997. 
HDB builds different flat types and sizes to cater to different needs and aspirations. The design considerations are based on the prevalent social and lifestyle trends, plus the demographic and economic conditions. 
Some of the factors and conditions that are considered include the needs and wants of home owners. After HDB started with basic 1 to 3-room flats in the 1960s, economic and social progress over the years saw an increased demand for bigger flat types. As a result, more 4 and 5-room flats were introduced into the market between 1975 and 1993, while the construction of 1 to 3-room flats was put on hold. The standard 4-room flats were sized between 85 and 105 square metres, while 5-room flats were about 123 square metres. 
However, with Singapore facing increasing land constraints, HDB began to adjust the sizes of its flats downwards, gradually. Nonetheless, the space enjoyed per person was no worse off, and actually increased over time. 
The prevalent 4 and 5-room flats built by HDB have remained constant in size since 1997, at 90 and 110 square metres respectively. And the measurements stated are strictly of the flat’s internal living space, and does not include planter boxes and air-conditioner ledges. 
However, over this period, there were a few exceptions to the norm, where the sizes were slightly larger or smaller than 90 square metres, to meet specific needs and to provide some variety and choice for flat applicants. For example, smaller 4-room replacement flats were built under the Selective En Bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS) to provide flat owners the opportunity and ability to upgrade, as the majority of the blocks selected at that time comprised 3-room flats. 
HDB has sought to improve flat designs while not compromising on flat sizes. The designs seek to meet Singaporeans’ desire for quality housing and to allow for better maximisation of available space. For instance, we have incorporated the dining area into the living area to provide a more spacious overall common living area. This has given residents greater flexibility in utilising this space. 
Arising from residents’ feedback, the service yard has also been separated from the kitchen, so laundry can be hung away from the kitchen area, unaffected by cooking fumes. The common toilet was also relocated from inside the kitchen to nearer the bedrooms, for the convenience of children and elderly members of the family.

b) Category B – Cars (1,601cc & above)
c) Category C – Goods Vehicles and Buses

Why doesn’t Government reveal the overall size of our reserves? 
It is not in our national interest to disclose the full amount of Singapore’s Financial Reserves. Full disclosure will make it easier for markets to mount speculative attacks on the Singapore dollar during periods of vulnerability. Furthermore, as a small country with no natural resources or other assets, our reserves are a key defence for Singapore in times of crisis. It would be unwise to reveal the full and exact resources at our disposal. Thus, confidential information of the exact figures must remain undisclosed as this is crucial to the survival of Singapore, especially in times of crisis.

Some international reports list Singapore as having high levels of Government debt. These include the CIA Public Debt Factbook and the World Economic
Forum report. Some are puzzled why this is so, as the Government runs a balanced budget. Some ask if it is fiscally sustainable to have such a high
level of debt.



 


The answer is ‘Yes’. This situation is fiscally sustainable. This is because these reports only look at gross debt. Taking into account our assets,
we have in fact no net debt.


Having debt means that we have liabilities. However, looking only at the liabilities alone (i.e. gross debt) does not
discriminate between two countries with the same level of debt but with very different levels of assets.


In Singapore’s case, we do not borrow to spend. We instead invest all borrowing proceeds. All borrowings are thus backed by assets. What we earn in
investment income from our assets is more than sufficient to cover the debt servicing costs. The Singapore Government in fact has a strong balance sheet
with assets well in excess of our liabilities.


This makes us a net creditor country, not a net debtor country.

 
This is why international credit rating agencies give the Singapore Government the highest short and long-term credit ratings of AAA.
In fact, in an April 2012 report by BlackRock Investment Institute, Singapore ranked 2nd in the BlackRock Sovereign Risk Index in terms of creditworthiness, with Singapore’s net asset position highlighted as a key strength.
If the Government runs balances budgets or budget surpluses, why do we still need to borrow money?
The Singapore Government does not borrow to fund its Budget. It operates on a balanced budget over each term of Government. 
The two types of domestic debt securities issued are for reasons unrelated to the Government’s fiscal needs:
(1) Singapore Government Securities (SGS) are issued to develop the domestic debt market. SGS are marketable debt instruments issued for purposes of developing Singapore's debt markets. They provide a risk-free benchmark against which other risky market instruments are priced off.
(2) Special Singapore Government Securities (SSGS) are non-tradable bonds issued specifically to meet the investment needs of the Central Provident Fund (CPF). Singaporeans’ CPF monies are invested in these special securities which are fully guaranteed by the Government. The securities earn for the CPF Board a coupon rate that is pegged to CPF interest rates that members receive.
Under the Constitution and the Government Securities Act, the Singapore Government cannot spend the monies raised from these two existing domestic debt securities. All borrowing proceeds from the issuance of SGS and SSGS are invested. These investment returns are more than sufficient to cover the debt servicing costs.

                Are BTO flats currently priced beyond the means of low to median income earners?
            ","
                    19 Feb 2018
                ","There are a lot of factors that contribute to the price you pay for your BTO flat, from the location of your BTO flat, to the size of your desired unit and even where in the spectrum your annual household income falls. All of these contribute in some way, but it is important to remember that BTO flats are priced across a fairly broad range, making it possible for lower income earners to reasonably afford a BTO flat as well. 
Let’s take a look at a possible scenario. A Singaporean couple are looking to apply for a BTO flat. They are both working and drawing an assumed constant combined monthly salary of S$7040, which was the median household income for 2011. Assuming that the couple gets a basic salary package (i.e. 12 months’ basic pay), that brings household income to $84,480 for this couple. 
So depending on the location and the size of flat that the couple chooses, their chosen BTO flat would cost anywhere between two to five times their annual income (see the table below for some examples), which is a fairly reasonable price for a house that will serve them well for many years.

Buying a house together marks the beginning of a new life together with your loved ones.  It is also a long term commitment.  As other needs and commitments may come along later on, couples are always encouraged to be prudent and to buy a home that they is within their means and which they will feel most comfortable paying for.  
To find out more about a better yardstick, the Debt Servicing Ratio, that HDB uses, read this article.

                HDB flats seem to be priced many times my annual income. How can I afford one?
            ","
                    19 Jun 2018
                ","Some measures of housing affordability use the Home Price-Income ratio (HPI), where a figure of 6, for instance, would indicate that the property being purchased is priced at six times the buyer’s current annual income. 
There is no international consensus on what figure signifies whether a property is affordable or not. In some leading international cities, such as Hong Kong or London, the HPI could be quite high, with some sources putting the HPI for Hong Kong in the double digits. In other countries, in areas away from centres of population or economic activity, the HPI could be lower. 
In Singapore, HDB uses the Debt Servicing Ratio, or DSR, as a more accurate indicator of actual housing affordability. The DSR refers to the proportion of the monthly household income set aside for housing instalments. 
This measurement takes into account interest payments, which the HPI does not. It is calculated on an assumed 30 year loan, and the figure would rise if the loan tenure were shortened. Correspondingly, a working household may reasonably expect salary increases over time, and, assuming a fixed tenure period, the actual DSR in later years of repayment may fall. 
HDB’s commitment to Singaporean households centres on the provision of new BTO flats. A typical first-time buyer of a new flat in a non-mature estate used on average, less than a quarter of their monthly income ( at the point of application) to pay for their housing loans. This means that most buyers are able to pay for their monthly instalments using CPF, with no or minimal cash outlay.  
Table 1: DSR for New HDB Flats Offered in Non-Mature Estates in 2012

   
Note:
1. Selling prices are based on new flats offered in 2012 in non-mature estates.
2. Median household income is based on first-timer applicants in 2012 in non-mature estates.
3. Monthly mortgage instalments based on concessionary interest rate of 2.6% over 30 years.
4. The Additional CPF Housing Grant (AHG) and Special CPF Housing Grant (SHG) are used to offset the 90% maximum loan where applicable, assuming that buyers have sufficient savings for the 10% downpayment.
5. The stamp, conveyancing and other fees payable to buy a flat are not included in the table above. 
For example, a buyer, with a lower monthly income of $2,500 may opt for a smaller 3-room flat in a non-mature estate, to be financially prudence. This buyer will only need to come up with a very minimal cash outlay of $4 for the monthly instalments.
The DSR levels for new HDB flats is set well within the acceptable international affordability benchmarks of 30-35 percent. With generous and targeted grants for the lower income, the typical buyers of smaller 2- and 3-room flats can enjoy a lower DSR, some with zero cash outlay.
While HDB works to ensure that new BTO flats are priced within reach of most working Singaporean families, individual households also need to adopt a prudent approach, and look for flat options that are within their means, after taking into account their other financial commitments over the long term.

                    19 Feb 2018
                ","The Goods and Services Tax (GST) was introduced in 1994 to diversify our tax base and reduce our reliance on direct taxes such as corporate and personal income taxes. Everyone in Singapore, including Singapore Permanent Residents (SPR) and foreigners, pays GST on the goods and services they buy.
When GST was introduced, this enabled the Government to lower personal income taxes from the top range of 33% progressively to 22% today.  Those paying income tax today also must earn above $20,000 per annum.  With these changes, many do not pay personal income tax. 
The money collected from GST forms part of the Government revenue which goes to fund expenditure for Singapore, such as the building of infrastructure like schools, roads, hospitals, MRT lines and other public facilities, and providing subsidies like health, housing and education subsidies.
The money collected from GST also enables the Government to use a significant part of it to help lower-income Singaporeans by funding social assistance schemes. As GST is administered at a flat rate, the Government is aware that the GST adds to the living costs of the lower-income families. To ensure that GST does not hurt the poor, GST Vouchers are given to lower-income families to offset what they pay for in GST.


With the GST Voucher, the GST paid by elderly households in 1- to 3-room HDB flats will be fully offset. For lower-income families who do not live with their elderly family members, half of their total GST expenses will be offset. 

Some have argued that a better way to help the poor with the cost of living would be to exempt basic necessities like rice from GST. However, besides the luxurious items that they can afford, richer Singaporeans also tend to spend more on basic necessities, like buying more expensive types of food.  They also end up paying more GST.  Hence, the rich would benefit more than needy Singaporeans if we were to exempt basic necessities from GST. Furthermore, the exemption will vastly decrease the GST collected which could be channelled to help the needy. 
Poorer Singaporeans stand to gain more from the GST Voucher and other permanent benefits such as Workfare, housing, education and healthcare, than if they were to receive an outright exemption of GST.

                ","What is the fastest and most efficient way for the Government to publicise procurement opportunities from the Public Service to as many suppliers as possible, so that everyone receives the information at the same time, and all businesses have an equal opportunity to submit their bids for the job? 
 
Some people suggest that the Government source for quotes directly from suppliers or publicise its procurement through the newspapers’ classified ads – like it used to do in the past. However, advances in technology have given us much better alternatives today. 
The Government Electronic Business or GeBIZ portal was developed specifically for this purpose. It is a fairer and more transparent procurement platform as all suppliers are given an equal opportunity to participate. All government agencies are required to post their invitations for tenders and quotations openly on GeBIZ. This is mandatory for all procurements above $5,000.
GeBIZ has built-in functions to safeguard the confidentiality of the bids submitted. The schedule of bids received and award notices for open tenders and quotations are published after the close of the tender/quotation to ensure transparency. 
 
What if only one bid is received?
To increase the likelihood that an adequate number of competitive bids are received, government agencies are advised to take the following measures:
Government agencies must assess the reasonableness of the bids regardless if a single or several bids have been received. When recommending the award of a tender/quotation based on a single bid, officers are required to justify to the Approving Authority why the single bid is considered competitive or reflective of fair market value. For example, they may have performed independent checks or consulted experienced buyers.  
If no reasonable bid has been received, agencies may call for a fresh quotation/tender, after revising their requirements, if necessary.  
How does the Government ensure that suppliers know of opportunities to participate in government tender/quotations? 
 
Suppliers who wish to participate in Government tenders or quotations can register easily as a GeBIZ Trading Partner where they will be issued with a free user account. They can also sign up for RSS or email alerts of relevant business opportunities whenever they are published on GeBIZ. Currently, there are over 50,000 registered GeBIZ trading partners. 
Government agencies may alert suppliers to opportunities that are published openly in GeBIZ, through the GeBIZ alert services or the agency’s website. This is to ensure that the procurement opportunity is publicised widely, while ensuring that procurement is carried out in a transparent manner via GeBIZ.
The Government also shares pertinent information on public sector pipeline projects to provide suppliers with better visibility of projects over the medium term. This helps businesses seek collaboration early to better plan for upcoming business opportunities. For example, IDA’s Infocomm Technology (ICT) Industry Briefing is held yearly to let suppliers know of upcoming ICT projects.

The CPI provides information on economy-wide consumer price changes and is useful to the government, companies and individuals as a guide for making economic decisions. 
However, as the CPI gives an indication of the inflation experienced by the general resident household, it will not correspond exactly to the personal experience of any particular household since every household’s spending pattern is unique. Depending on the goods and services actually purchased by each individual household, changes in prices will impact each household to a different extent. 

 
  
Price quotes for items in the CPI basket are collected from a large number of retailers with a wide range of sizes and packaging (including those sold singly, in bulk or on discount). The price level for each item in the CPI in a particular month is the average across the surveyed retailers.  Thus, if you purchase an item from a retailer who has raised prices significantly, the CPI may only show a modest increase if other retailers largely held prices of the same item steady.

                ","You may have read about PUB’s plans to build a diversion canal and a water detention tank to increase flood protection for the Stamford Canal catchment.  
 
These are necessary investments in infrastructure that PUB is making, as part of its action plan to strengthen Singapore’s flood resilience, in order to ensure that Singapore’s drainage system remains robust and adaptable, to cope with future uncertainty. 
One of the main factors for this uncertainty is expected greater volatility and greater intensity of rain. The Government-appointed Expert Panel for Drainage Design and Flood Protection Measures (full report released in Jan 2012) had found that there is strong evidence of a trend towards higher rainfall intensities and frequency of intense rains, in reviewing rainfall records over the last 30 years. 
 
Find out more details about this below.
 With increasing urbanisation and greater weather uncertainties, PUB recognises that more must be done to ensure that Singapore’s drainage system remains robust and adaptable. As far as the weather is concerned, we could expect greater volatility and greater intensity of rain, and our drainage systems will therefore need to cope with future uncertainty.
The intensity of rainfall within a specific duration is a critical factor in determining whether the drainage capacity will be overwhelmed during a storm, and result in flash floods. 
The Expert Panel in its report noted that in Singapore, “heavy rainfall events impose varying constraints on its drainage systems. Extreme discharges can result from events ranging from high intensity storms lasting less than an hour to prolonged rainstorm events with moderate rainfall intensities. Based on the rainfall intensity records over the past 30 years, there is strong evidence of a trend towards higher rainfall intensities and frequency of intense rains. These up-trends are consistent with the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change 4th Assessment Report (IPCC AR4) and could add further strain on Singapore’s existing drainage infrastructure.” 
The Expert Panel elaborated that: 
• A statistically significant uptrend in the annual maximum hourly rainfall total is observed for Singapore as a whole. The average rate of increase is about 10 mm per decade, rising from 80 mm in 1980 to 110 mm in 2010.

Annual maximum 60-min rainfall total of 28 Stations (1980-2010). The blue lines denote the trend and the 95% confidence interval.
• Statistically significant up-trends in the annual number of days with hourly rainfall totals exceeding 70 mm are observed for Singapore as a whole. The average rate of increase is about 1.8 days per decade for the 70 mm threshold.
Figure 2 – Annual Frequency of Occurrence of Hourly Rainfall Total exceeding 70mm

 
Plot of annual frequency of occurrence of hourly rainfall total exceeding 70 mm showed a statistically significant uptrend with an average rate of 1.8 days per decade. The trend is indicated by the blue line and the 95% confidence interval.
 
The Panel concluded that “a wider range of interventions is required to help Singapore secure a more adequate drainage system for the future. As part of the drainage planning process, PUB should consider a wider range of drainage solutions, or interventions. By implementing a range of appropriate measures that covers every spectrum of the drainage system from its source (e.g. local storage tanks and ponds, green roofs, rain gardens, porous pavements, etc), pathways (e.g. drain capacity improvements, diversion canals, regional detention, etc) and receptors (e.g. urban flood plains, raised platform levels, flood barriers, etc), flood risk within the drainage catchment can be more significantly reduced and effectively managed.
PUB accepted the recommendations of the Expert Panel for Drainage Design and Flood Protection Measures and announced in January 2012 its action plan to strengthen Singapore’s flood resilience via a multi-pronged plan that covers the entire spectrum of drainage and flood management.  For example, to better protect the Stamford Canal catchment, PUB announced in July 2012 that it will be building a detention tank and a diversion canal.
PUB acknowledges that it is not possible to predict the future. But its drainage planning must evolve, and it will make the necessary investments in infrastructure to cope with a more volatile and uncertain future.

                ","“Aren’t the bus operators already making profits which could be used to fund the new buses?”  you might ask. Well, the public bus industry is already running at an operating loss . Did you know that from 2006 to 2011, fuel prices went up by about 34%, national wages by about 26% and yet public transport fares increased by 0.3%?  Under such circumstances, it is difficult for bus operators to realistically increase their capacity and improve service levels in such a large and quick step, unless fares were sharply increased. 
So, how will the $1.1 billion be used to expand bus capacity?
The $1.1 billion package will be used to buy and run 550 more public buses for the next 10 years. 300 of these buses will go towards reducing crowding and improving the frequencies of existing bus services and the remaining 250 will be used to run about 40 new bus routes.
  
In addition to the 550 buses funded by the Government, the PTOs will add another 250 buses to their fleet at their own cost. This will add a total of 800 new buses which will expand the current public bus fleet by 20%. 70% of the new buses will be added within the first 3 years. 
Will the $1.1billion be used to fatten the profits of the privately owned bus companies?
No. Government funding will only cover the additional costs incurred in running the programme, after deducting any revenue collected and no profits will be made by the PTOs from running this programme. If the costs are lower than expected, the funding will be cut accordingly.
This project will provide commuters with more comfortable bus rides. This means that you will have more space (more personal space to watch shows on your smartphones comfortably. Loading levels will decrease from 95% of bus licensed capacity to 85%), buses coming at higher frequencies (time saved and since time = money = money saved) and new bus services to offer you more travel options.

It is not just drivers who benefit. People who take buses and taxis will also get to enjoy a smoother ride on the roads. 
The NSE will also help connect other parts of Singapore better. For example, today, people from the west cannot go from the Pan-Island Expressway (PIE) to the CTE towards the CBD directly. With the NSE, they will enjoy a direct route to the CBD.
